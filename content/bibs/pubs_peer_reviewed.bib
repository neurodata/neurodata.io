Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers.The Clinical and Translational Science Award Program and scientific community created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and reproducible collaborative analytics.Organized in inclusive workstreams, we created legal agreements and governance for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19 cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to democratize data access.The N3C has demonstrated that a multisite collaborative learning health network can overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure incorporating multiorganizational clinical data for COVID-19 analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19.}",

 abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has unlocked unprecedented success in various domains, especially in image, text, and speech processing. These breakthroughs may hold promise for neuroscience and especially for brain-imaging investigators who start to analyze thousands of participants. However, deep learning is only beneficial if the data have nonlinear relationships and if they are exploitable at currently available sample sizes. We systematically profiled the performance of deep models, kernel models, and linear models as a function of sample size on UK Biobank brain images against established machine learning references. On MNIST and Zalando Fashion, prediction accuracy consistently improved when escalating from linear models to shallow-nonlinear models, and further improved when switching to deep-nonlinear models. The more observations were available for model training, the greater the performance gain we saw. In contrast, using structural or functional brain scans, simple linear models performed on par with more complex, highly parameterized models in age/sex prediction across increasing sample sizes. In fact, linear models kept improving as the sample size approached \~{}10,000 participants. Our results indicate that the increase in performance of linear models with additional data does not saturate at the limit of current feasibility. Yet, nonlinearities of common brain scans remain largely inaccessible to both kernel and deep learning methods at any examined scale.},

We generated whole brain structural MRI and diffusion connectomes for four diverse isogenic lines of mice (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, CAST/EiJ, and BTBR) at spatial resolution 20,000 times higher than human connectomes. We measured narrow sense heritability (h2) I.e. the fraction of variance explained by strains in a simple ANOVA model for volumes and scalar diffusion metrics, and estimates of residual technical error for 166 regions in each hemisphere and connectivity between the regions. Volumes of discrete brain regions had the highest mean heritability (0.71 ± 0.23 SD, n = 332), followed by fractional anisotropy (0.54 ± 0.26), radial diffusivity (0.34 ± 0.022), and axial diffusivity (0.28 ± 0.19). Connection profiles were statistically different in 280 of 322 nodes across all four strains. Nearly 150 of the connection profiles were statistically different between the C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and CAST/EiJ lines. Microscopic whole brain MRI/DTI has allowed us to identify significant heritable phenotypes in brain volume, scalar DTI metrics, and quantitative connectomes.}

abstract ={A common coordinate space enabling comparison across individuals is vital to understanding human brain organization and individual differences. By leveraging dimensionality reduction algorithms, high-dimensional fMRI data can be represented in a low-dimensional space to characterize individual features. Such a representative space encodes the functional architecture of individuals and enables the observation of functional changes across time. However, determining comparable functional features across individuals in resting-state fMRI in a way that simultaneously preserves individual-specific connectivity structure can be challenging. In this work we propose scalable joint embedding to simultaneously embed multiple individual brain connectomes within a common space that allows individual representations across datasets to be aligned. Using Human Connectome Project data, we evaluated the joint embedding approach by comparing it to the previously established orthonormal alignment model. Alignment using joint embedding substantially increased the similarity of functional representations across individuals while simultaneously capturing their distinct profiles, allowing individuals to be more discriminable from each other. Additionally, we demonstrated that the common space established using resting-state fMRI provides a better overlap of task-activation across participants. Finally, in a more challenging scenario - alignment across a lifespan cohort aged from 6 to 85 - joint embedding provided a better prediction of age (r2 = 0.65) than the prior alignment model. It facilitated the characterization of functional trajectories across lifespan. Overall, these analyses establish that joint embedding can simultaneously capture individual neural representations in a common connectivity space aligning functional data across participants and populations and preserve individual specificity.}

abstract ={Evolution provides an important window into how cortical organization shapes function and vice versa. The complex mosaic of changes in brain morphology and functional organization that have shaped the mammalian cortex during evolution, complicates attempts to chart cortical differences across species. It limits our ability to fully appreciate how evolution has shaped our brain, especially in systems associated with unique human cognitive capabilities that lack anatomical homologues in other species. Here, we develop a function-based method for cross-species alignment that enables the quantification of homologous regions between humans and rhesus macaques, even when their location is decoupled from anatomical landmarks. Critically, we find cross-species similarity in functional organization reflects a gradient of evolutionary change that decreases from unimodal systems and culminates with the most pronounced changes in posterior regions of the default mode network (angular gyrus, posterior cingulate and middle temporal cortices). Our findings suggest that the establishment of the default mode network, as the apex of a cognitive hierarchy, has changed in a complex manner during human evolution – even within subnetworks}

abstract = {Together with the curse of dimensionality, nonlinear dependencies in large data sets persist as major challenges in data mining tasks. A reliable way to accurately preserve nonlinear structure is to compute geodesic distances between data points. Manifold learning methods, such as Isomap, aim to preserve geodesic distances in a Riemannian manifold. However, as manifold learning algorithms operate on the ambient dimensionality of the data, the essential step of geodesic distance computation is sensitive to high-dimensional noise. Therefore, a direct application of these algorithms to high-dimensional, noisy data often yields unsatisfactory results and does not accurately capture nonlinear structure.We propose an unsupervised random forest approach called geodesic forests (GF) to geodesic distance estimation in linear and nonlinear manifolds with noise. GF operates on low-dimensional sparse linear combinations of features, rather than the full observed dimensionality. To choose the optimal split in a computationally efficient fashion, we developed Fast-BIC, a fast Bayesian Information Criterion statistic for Gaussian mixture models.We additionally propose geodesic precision and geodesic recall as novel evaluation metrics that quantify how well the geodesic distances of a latent manifold are preserved. Empirical results on simulated and real data demonstrate that GF is robust to high-dimensional noise, whereas other methods, such as Isomap, UMAP, and FLANN, quickly deteriorate in such settings. Notably, GF is able to estimate geodesic distances better than other approaches on a real connectome dataset},

abstract ={There is a consensus that substantial heterogeneity underlies the neurobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As such, it has become increasingly clear that a dissection of variation at the molecular, cellular, and brain network domains is a prerequisite for identifying biomarkers. Neuroimaging has been widely used to characterize atypical brain patterns in ASD, although findings have varied across studies. This is due, at least in part, to a failure to account for neurobiological heterogeneity. Here, we summarize emerging data-driven efforts to delineate more homogeneous ASD subgroups at the level of brain structure and function—that is, neurosubtyping. We break this pursuit into key methodological steps: the selection of diagnostic samples, neuroimaging features, algorithms, and validation approaches. Although preliminary and methodologically diverse, current studies generally agree that at least 2 to 4 distinct ASD neurosubtypes may exist. Their identification improved symptom prediction and diagnostic label accuracy above and beyond group average comparisons. Yet, this nascent literature has shed light onto challenges and gaps. These include 1) the need for wider and more deeply transdiagnostic samples collected while minimizing artifacts (e.g., head motion), 2) quantitative and unbiased methods for feature selection and multimodal fusion, 3) greater emphasis on algorithms’ ability to capture hybrid dimensional and categorical models of ASD, and 4) systematic independent replications and validations that integrate different units of analyses across multiple scales. Solutions aimed to address these challenges and gaps are discussed for future avenues leading toward a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying ASD heterogeneity}

 abstract = {Biological and social systems consist of myriad interacting units. The interactions can be represented in the form of a graph or network. Measurements of these graphs can reveal the underlying structure of these interactions, which provides insight into the systems that generated the graphs. Moreover, in applications such as connectomics, social networks, and genomics, graph data are accompanied by contextualizing measures on each node. We utilize these node covariates to help uncover latent communities in a graph, using a modification of spectral clustering. Statistical guarantees are provided under a joint mixture model that we call the node-contextualized stochastic blockmodel, including a bound on the mis-clustering rate. The bound is used to derive conditions for achieving perfect clustering. For most simulated cases, covariate-assisted spectral clustering yields results superior to regularized spectral clustering without node covariates and to an adaptation of canonical correlation analysis. We apply our clustering method to large brain graphs derived from diffusion MRI data, using the node locations or neurological region membership as covariates. In both cases, covariate-assisted spectral clustering yields clusters that are easier to interpret neurologically.},

Our methodology improves over the previous state of the art principally in four ways. First, via sharing information across channels, we can better distinguish between single-unit spikes and artifacts. Second, our proposed "focused mixture model" (FMM) deals with units appearing, disappearing, or reappearing over multiple recording days, an important consideration for any chronic experiment. Third, by jointly learning features and clusters, we improve performance over previous attempts that proceeded via a two-stage learning process. Fourth, by directly modeling spike rate, we improve the detection of sparsely firing neurons. Moreover, our Bayesian methodology seamlessly handles missing data. We present the state-of-the-art performance without requiring manually tuning hyperparameters, considering both a public dataset with partial ground truth and a new experimental dataset. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

 abstract = {For random graphs distributed according to stochastic blockmodels, a special case of latent position graphs, adjacency spectral embedding followed by appropriate vertex classification is asymptotically Bayes optimal; but this approach requires knowledge of and critically depends on the model dimension. In this paper, we propose a sparse representation vertex classifier which does not require information about the model dimension. This classifier represents a test vertex as a sparse combination of the vertices in the training set and uses the recovered coefficients to classify the test vertex. We prove consistency of our proposed classifier for stochastic blockmodels, and demonstrate that the sparse representation classifier can predict vertex labels with higher accuracy than adjacency spectral embedding approaches via both simulation studies and real data experiments. Our results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed vertex classifier when the model dimension is unknown.},

 abstract = {High-dimensional time-series data from a wide variety of domains, such as neuroscience, are being generated every day. Fitting statistical models to such data, to enable parameter estimation and time-series prediction, is an important computational primitive. Existing methods, however, are unable to cope with the high-dimensional nature of these data, due to both computational and statistical reasons. We mitigate both kinds of issues by proposing an M-estimator for Reduced-rank System IDentification (Mr. Sid). A combination of low-rank approximations, ℓ1 and ℓ2 penalties, and some numerical linear algebra tricks, yields an estimator that is computationally efficient and numerically stable. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a variety of problems. In particular, we demonstrate that Mr. Sid can accurately estimate spatial filters, connectivity graphs, and time-courses from native resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Mr. Sid therefore enables big time-series data to be analyzed using standard methods, readying the field for further generalizations including nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models.},

 abstract = {It is widely believed that human brain is a complicated network and many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related to abnormal changes of the brain network architecture. In this work, we present a kernel-based method to establish a network for each subject using mean cortical thickness, which we refer to hereafter as the individual's network. We construct individual networks for 83 subjects, including AD patients and normal controls (NC), which are taken from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. The network edge features are used to make prediction of AD/NC through the sophisticated machine learning technology. As the number of edge features is much more than that of samples, feature selection is applied to avoid the adverse impact of high-dimensional data on the performance of classifier. We use a hybrid feature selection that combines filter and wrapper methods, and compare the performance of six different combinations of them. Finally, support vector machines are trained using the selected features. To obtain an unbiased evaluation of our method, we use a nested cross validation framework to choose the optimal hyper-parameters of classifier and evaluate the generalization of the method. We report the best accuracy of 90.4 {\%} using the proposed method in the leave-one-out analysis, outperforming that using the raw cortical thickness data by more than 10 {\%}.},

@article{Durante2016,
 abstract = {Replicated network data are increasingly available in many research fields. For example, in connectomic applications, interconnections among brain regions are collected for each patient under study, motivating statistical models which can flexibly characterize the probabilistic generative mechanism underlying these network-valued data. Available models for a single network are not designed specifically for inference on the entire probability mass function of a network-valued random variable and therefore lack flexibility in characterizing the distribution of relevant topological structures. We propose a flexible Bayesian nonparametric approach for modeling the population distribution of network-valued data. The joint distribution of the edges is defined via a mixture model that reduces dimensionality and efficiently incorporates network information within each mixture component by leveraging latent space representations. The formulation leads to an efficient Gibbs sampler and provides simple and coherent strategies for inference and goodness-of-fit assessments. We provide theoretical results on the flexibility of our model and illustrate improved performance—compared to state-of-the-art models—in simulations and application to human brain networks.

Here we demonstrate the use of synchrotron X-ray microtomography ($\mu$CT) for producing mesoscale $(1\sim\mu m^3)$ resolution brain maps from millimeter-scale volumes of mouse brain. We introduce a pipeline for $\mu$CT-based brain mapping that combines methods for sample preparation, imaging, automated segmentation of image volumes into cells and blood vessels, and statistical analysis of the resulting brain structures. Our results demonstrate that X-ray tomography promises rapid quantification of large brain volumes, complementing other brain mapping and connectomics efforts.},

@article{Fishkind2013,
 abstract = {For random graphs distributed according to a stochastic block model, we consider the inferential task of partitioning vertices into blocks using spectral techniques. Spectral partitioning using the normalized Laplacian and the adjacency matrix have both been shown to be consistent as the number of vertices tend to infinity. Importantly, both procedures require that the number of blocks and the rank of the communication probability matrix be known, even as the rest of the parameters may be unknown. In this paper, we prove that the (suitably modified) adjacency-spectral partitioning procedure, requiring only an upper bound on the rank of the communication probability matrix, is consistent. Indeed, this result demonstrates a robustness to model mis-specification; an overestimate of the rank may impose a moderate performance penalty, but the procedure is still consistent. Furthermore, we extend this procedure to the setting where adjacencies may have multiple modalities and we allow for either directed or undirected graphs.},

 abstract = {Allelic deletions involving the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p13-21.1) have been observed frequently in cervical carcinomas. Recently, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad), was cloned and mapped to this chromosomal region (3p14.2). Abnormal FHIT transcripts have been identified previously in a variety of tumor cell lines and primary carcinomas, although their significance and the molecular mechanisms underlying their origin remain incompletely defined. In addition, integration of human papillomavirus DNA has been identified at a fragile site (FRA3B) within the FHIT locus in cervical cancer. These observations motivated us to evaluate FHIT mRNA and protein expression in cervical cancer cell lines, primary cervical carcinomas, and normal tissues. Transcripts of the expected size and sequence were the predominant species identified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in cultured keratinocytes and all normal tissues evaluated. In contrast, aberrant FHIT transcripts were readily demonstrated in 6 of 7 cervical carcinoma cell lines and 17 of 25 (68\%) primary cervical carcinomas. Northern blot analyses demonstrated reduced or absent FHIT expression in the cervical carcinoma cell lines, particularly those with aberrant RT-PCR products. Immunohistochemical analysis of Fhit expression in cervical tissues revealed strong immunoreactivity in nonneoplastic squamous and glandular cervical epithelium and marked reduction or loss of Fhit protein in 25 of 33 (76{\%}) primary cervical carcinomas. In those cervical cancer cell lines and primary tumors with exclusively aberrant or absent FHIT transcripts by RT-PCR, Fhit protein expression was always markedly reduced or absent. The frequent alterations in FHIT expression in many cervical carcinomas, but not in normal tissues, suggest that FHIT gene alterations may play an important role in cervical tumorigenesis.},

Three volumes of hippocampal CA1 neuropil from adult rat were imaged at X-Y resolution of ∼2 nm on serial sections of ∼50-60 nm thickness. These are the first densely reconstructed hippocampal volumes. All axons, dendrites, glia, and synapses were reconstructed in a cube (∼10 $\mu$m 3) surrounding a large dendritic spine, a cylinder (∼43 $\mu$m 3) surrounding an oblique dendritic segment (3.4 $\mu$m long), and a parallelepiped (∼178 $\mu$m 3) surrounding an apical dendritic segment (4.9 $\mu$m long). The data provide standards for identifying ultrastructural objects in 4DEM, realistic reconstructions for modeling biophysical properties of synaptic transmission, and a test bed for enhancing reconstruction tools. Representative synapses are quantified from varying section planes, and microtubules, polyribosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomes are identified and reconstructed in a subset of dendrites.

 abstract = {High-resolution serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM) makes it possible to investigate the dense meshwork of axons, dendrites, synapses that form neuronal circuits. However, the imaging scale required to comprehensively reconstruct these structures is more than ten orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial extents occupied by networks of interconnected neurons, some of which span nearly the entire brain. Difficulties in generating and handling data for large volumes at nanoscale resolution have thus restricted vertebrate studies to fragments of circuits. These efforts were recently transformed by advances in computing, sample handling, imaging techniques, but high-resolution examination of entire brains remains a challenge. Here, we present ssEM data for the complete brain of a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 5.5 days post-fertilization. Our approach utilizes multiple rounds of targeted imaging at different scales to reduce acquisition time and data management requirements. The resulting dataset can be analysed to reconstruct neuronal processes, permitting us to survey all myelinated axons (the projectome). These reconstructions enable precise investigations of neuronal morphology, which reveal remarkable bilateral symmetry in myelinated reticulospinal and lateral line afferent axons. We further set the stage for whole-brain structure-function comparisons by co-registering functional reference atlases and in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy data from the same specimen. All obtained images and reconstructions are provided as an open-access resource.},

How these intrinsic and extrinsic factors govern the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations is unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, we investigated the dependencies between synaptic connectivity, feature selectivity and network activity in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in mouse visual cortex. In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways.},

 abstract = {We describe automated technologies to probe the structure of neural tissue at nanometer resolution and use them to generate a saturated reconstruction of a sub-volume of mouse neocortex in which all cellular objects (axons, dendrites, and glia) and many sub-cellular components (synapses, synaptic vesicles, spines, spine apparati, postsynaptic densities, and mitochondria) are rendered and itemized in a database. We explore these data to study physical properties of brain tissue. For example, by tracing the trajectories of all excitatory axons and noting their juxtapositions, both synaptic and non-synaptic, with every dendritic spine we refute the idea that physical proximity is sufficient to predict synaptic connectivity (the so-called Peters' rule). This online minable database provides general access to the intrinsic complexity of the neocortex and enables further data-driven inquiries. Video Abstract},

 abstract = {Modern technologies are enabling scientists to collect extraordinary amounts of complex and sophisticated data across a huge range of scales like never before. With this onslaught of data, we can allow the focal point to shift from data collection to data analysis. Unfortunately, lack of standardized sharing mechanisms and practices often make reproducing or extending scientific results very difficult. With the creation of data organization structures and tools that drastically improve code portability, we now have the opportunity to design such a framework for communicating extensible scientific discoveries. Our proposed solution leverages these existing technologies and standards, and provides an accessible and extensible model for reproducible research, called 'science in the cloud' (SIC). Exploiting scientific containers, cloud computing, and cloud data services, we show the capability to compute in the cloud and run a web service that enables intimate interaction with the tools and data presented. We hope this model will inspire the community to produce reproducible and, importantly, extensible results that will enable us to collectively accelerate the rate at which scientific breakthroughs are discovered, replicated, and extended.},

 abstract = {Wearable devices provide a means of tracking hand position in relation to the head, but have mostly relied on wrist-worn inertial measurement unit sensors and proximity sensors, which are inadequate for identifying specific locations. This limits their utility for accurate and precise monitoring of behaviors or providing feedback to guide behaviors. A potential clinical application is monitoring body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), recurrent, injurious behaviors directed toward the body, such as nail biting and hair pulling, which are often misdiagnosed and undertreated. Here, we demonstrate that including thermal sensors achieves higher accuracy in position tracking when compared against inertial measurement unit and proximity sensor data alone. Our Tingle device distinguished between behaviors from six locations on the head across 39 adult participants, with high AUROC values (best was back of the head: median (1.0), median absolute deviation (0.0); worst was on the cheek: median (0.93), median absolute deviation (0.09)). This study presents preliminary evidence of the advantage of including thermal sensors for position tracking and the Tingle wearable device's potential use in a wide variety of settings, including BFRB diagnosis and management.},

 abstract = {How much has a network changed since yesterday? How different is the wiring of Bob's brain (a left-handed male) and Alice's brain (a right-handed female), and how is it different? Graph similarity with given node correspondence, i.e., the detection of changes in the connectivity of graphs, arises in numerous settings. In this work, we formally state the axioms and desired properties of the graph similarity functions, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect crucial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose DELTACON, a principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that assesses the similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g., employees of a company, customers of a mobile carrier). In conjunction, we propose DELTACON-ATTR, a related approach that enables attribution of change or dissimilarity to responsible nodes and edges. Experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over existing similarity measures. Finally, we employ DELTACON and DELTACON-ATTR on real applications: (a) we classify people to groups of high and low creativity based on their brain connectivity graphs, (b) do temporal anomaly detection in the who-emails-whom Enron graph and find the top culprits for the changes in the temporal corporate email graph, and (c) recover pairs of test-retest large brain scans (∼17M edges, up to 90M edges) for 21 subjects.},

 abstract = {Graph matching - aligning a pair of graphs to minimize their edge disagreements - has received wide-spread attention from both theoretical and applied communities over the past several decades, including combinatorics, computer vision, and connectomics. Its attention can be partially attributed to its computational difficulty. Although many heuristics have previously been proposed in the literature to approximately solve graph matching, very few have any theoretical support for their performance. A common technique is to relax the discrete problem to a continuous problem, therefore enabling practitioners to bring gradient-descent-type algorithms to bear. We prove that an indefinite relaxation (when solved exactly) almost always discovers the optimal permutation, while a common convex relaxation almost always fails to discover the optimal permutation. These theoretical results suggest that initializing the indefinite algorithm with the convex optimum might yield improved practical performance. Indeed, experimental results illuminate and corroborate these theoretical findings, demonstrating that excellent results are achieved in both benchmark and real data problems by amalgamating the two approaches.},

Recently-introduced calcium fluorescent imaging methods permit experimentalists to observe network activity in large popu lations of neurons, but these techniques provide only indirect observations of neural spike trains, with limited time resolution and signal quality. In this work we present a Bayesian approach for inferring neural circuitry given this type of imaging data. We model the network activity in terms of a collec tion of coupled hidden Markov chains, with each chain corresponding to a single neuron in the network and the coupling between the chains reflecting the network's connectivity matrix. We derive a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for fitting the model parameters; to obtain the suf ficient statistics in a computationally-efficient manner, we introduce a spe cialized blockwise-Gibbs algorithm for sampling from the joint activity of all observed neurons given the observed fluorescence data. We perform large scale simulations of randomly connected neuronal networks with biophysi cally realistic parameters and find that the proposed methods can accurately infer the connectivity in these networks given reasonable experimental and computational constraints. In addition, the estimation accuracy may be im proved significantly by incorporating prior knowledge about the sparseness of connectivity in the network, via standard L$\backslash$ penalization methods.},

@article{Paninski2010,
 abstract = {State space methods have proven indispensable in neural data analysis. However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Priebe2015,
 abstract = {Statistical inference on graphs is a burgeoning field in the applied and theoretical statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of science, engineering, business, etc. In many applications, we are faced with the reality of errorfully observed graphs. That is, the existence of an edge between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this article, we consider a graph G = (V, E). We wish to perform an inference task—the inference task considered here is “vertex classification,” that is, given a vertex v with unknown label Y(v), we want to infer the label for v based on the graph G and the given labels for some set of vertices in G not containing v. However, we do not observe G; rather, for each potential edge (Formula presented.) we observe an “edge feature” that we use to classify uv as edge/not-edge. Thus, we errorfully observe G when we observe the graph (Formula presented.) as the edges in (Formula presented.) arise from the classifications of the “edge features,” and are expected to be errorful. Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge features we observe—more informative edge features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality trade-off for a simple class of random graphs model, namely, the stochastic blockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for classifying v and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating points for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the issue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize performance for the ultimate inference task. Finally, we investigate the quantity/quality tradeoff for errorful observations of the C. elegans connectome graph.},

 abstract = {Much recent attention has been paid to quantifying anatomic and functional neuroimaging on the individual subject level. For optimal individual subject characterization, specific acquisition and analysis features need to be identified that maximize interindividual variability while concomitantly minimizing intra-subject variability. We delineate the effect of various acquisition parameters (length of acquisition, sampling frequency) and analysis methods (time course extraction, region of interest parcellation, and thresholding of connectivity-derived network graphs) on characterizing individual subject differentiation. We utilize a non-parametric statistical metric that quantifies the degree to which a parameter set allows this individual subject differentiation by both maximizing interindividual variance and minimizing intra-individual variance. We apply this metric to analysis of four publicly available test-retest resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data sets. We find that for the question of maximizing individual differentiation, (i) for increasing sampling, there is a relative tradeoff between increased sampling frequency and increased acquisition time; (ii) for the sizes of the interrogated data sets, only 3-4 min of acquisition time was sufficient to maximally differentiate each subject with an algorithm that utilized no a priori information regarding subject identification; and (iii) brain regions that most contribute to this individual subject characterization lie in the default mode, attention, and executive control networks. These findings may guide optimal rs-fMRI experiment design and may elucidate the neural bases for subject-to-subject differences.},

 abstract = {New DNA sequencing methods will soon make it possible to identify all germline variants in any individual at a reasonable cost. However, the ability of whole-genome sequencing to predict predisposition to common diseases in the general population is unknown. To estimate this predictive capacity, we use the concept of a "genometype." A specific genometype represents the genomes in the population conferring a specific level of genetic risk for a specified disease. Using this concept, we estimated the maximum capacity of whole-genome sequencing to identify individuals at clinically significant risk for 24 different diseases. Our estimates were derived from the analysis of large numbers of monozygotic twin pairs; twins of a pair share the same genometype and therefore identical genetic risk factors. Our analyses indicate that (i) for 23 of the 24 diseases, most of the individuals will receive negative test results; (ii) these negative test results will, in general, not be very informative, because the risk of developing 19 of the 24 diseases in those who test negative will still be, at minimum, 50 to 80{\%} of that in the general population; and (iii) on the positive side, in the best-case scenario, more than 90{\%} of tested individuals might be alerted to a clinically significant predisposition to at least one disease. These results have important implications for the valuation of genetic testing by industry, health insurance companies, public policy-makers, and consumers.},

 abstract = {Reconstructing a map of neuronal connectivity is a critical challenge in contemporary neuroscience. Recent advances in high-throughput serial section electron microscopy (EM) have produced massive 3D image volumes of nanoscale brain tissue for the first time. The resolution of EM allows for individual neurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Recovering neuronal networks by manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is unmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image processing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the solution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse identification). In this manuscript we present the first fully-automated images-to-graphs pipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue and produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall performance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a metric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We evaluate a set of algorithms and parameters, searching possible operating points to identify the best available brain graph for our assessment metric. Finally, we deploy a reference end-to-end version of the pipeline on a large, publicly available data set. This provides a baseline result and framework for community analysis and future algorithm development and testing. All code and data derivatives have been made publicly available in support of eventually unlocking new biofidelic computational primitives and understanding of neuropathologies.},

Other methods may require double or triple the number of samples to achieve the same statistical power as MGC in a benchmark suite including high-dimensional and nonlinear relationships, with dimensionality ranging from 1 to 1000.

 abstract = {Matching datasets of multiple modalities has become an important task in data analysis. Existing methods often rely on the embedding and transformation of each single modality without utilizing any correspondence information, which often results in sub-optimal matching performance. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear manifold matching algorithm using shortest-path distance and joint neighborhood selection. Specifically, a joint nearest-neighbor graph is built for all modalities. Then the shortest-path distance within each modality is calculated from the joint neighborhood graph, followed by embedding into and matching in a common low-dimensional Euclidean space. Compared to existing algorithms, our approach exhibits superior performance for matching disparate datasets of multiple modalities.},

@article{simhal2017probabilistic,
 abstract = {Deeper exploration of the brain's vast synaptic networks will require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose those networks. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical.},

@article{Sweeney2014,
 abstract = {Machine learning is a popular method for mining and analyzing large collections of medical data. We focus on a particular problem from medical research, supervised multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We examine the extent to which the choice of machine learning or classification algorithm and feature extraction function impacts the performance of lesion segmentation methods. As quantitative measures derived from structural MRI are important clinical tools for research into the pathophysiology and natural history of MS, the development of automated lesion segmentation methods is an active research field. Yet, little is known about what drives performance of these methods. We evaluate the performance of automated MS lesion segmentation methods, which consist of a supervised classification algorithm composed with a feature extraction function. These feature extraction functions act on the observed T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI voxel intensities. Each MRI study has a manual lesion segmentation that we use to train and validate the supervised classification algorithms. Our main finding is that the differences in predictive performance are due more to differences in the feature vectors, rather than the machine learning or classification algorithms. Features that incorporate information from neighboring voxels in the brain were found to increase performance substantially. For lesion segmentation, we conclude that it is better to use simple, interpretable, and fast algorithms, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis, and to develop the features to improve performance.},

 abstract = {A vertical asymmetry in memory-guided saccadic eye movements has been previously demonstrated in humans and in rhesus monkeys. In the upright orientation, saccades generally land several degrees above the target. The origin of this asymmetry has remained unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the asymmetry in memory saccades is dependent on body orientation in space. Thus animals performed memory saccades in four different body orientations: upright, left-side-down (LSD), right-side-down (RSD), and supine. Data in all three rhesus monkeys confirm previous observations regarding a significant upward vertical asymmetry. Saccade errors made from LSD and RSD postures were partitioned into components made along the axis of gravity and along the vertical body axis. Up/down asymmetry persisted only in body coordinates but not in gravity coordinates. However, this asymmetry was generally reduced in tilted positions. Therefore the upward bias seen in memory saccades is egocentric although orientation in space might play a modulatory role.},

 abstract = {A mixed-signal very large scale integration (VLSI) chip for large scale emulation of spiking neural networks is presented. The chip contains 2400 silicon neurons with fully programmable and reconfigurable synaptic connectivity. Each neuron implements a discrete-time model of a single-compartment cell. The model allows for analog membrane dynamics and an arbitrary number of synaptic connections, each with tunable conductance and reversal potential. The array of silicon neurons functions as an address-event (AE) transceiver, with incoming and outgoing spikes communicated over an asynchronous event-driven digital bus. Address encoding and conflict resolution of spiking events are implemented via a randomized arbitration scheme that ensures balanced servicing of event requests across the array. Routing of events is implemented externally using dynamically programmable random-access memory that stores a postsynaptic address, the conductance, and the reversal potential of each synaptic connection. Here, we describe the silicon neuron circuits, present experimental data characterizing the 3 mm x 3 mm chip fabricated in 0.5-micron complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and demonstrate its utility by configuring the hardware to emulate a model of attractor dynamics and waves of neural activity during sleep in rat hippocampus.},

 abstract = {As recent advances in calcium sensing technologies facilitate simultaneously imaging action potentials in neuronal populations, complementary analytical tools must also be developed to maximize the utility of this experimental paradigm. Although the observations here are fluorescence movies, the signals of interest - spike trains and/or time varying intracellular calcium concentrations - are hidden. Inferring these hidden signals is often problematic due to noise, nonlinearities, slow imaging rate, and unknown biophysical parameters. We overcome these difficulties by developing sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters) based on biophysical models of spiking, calcium dynamics, and fluorescence. We show that even in simple cases, the particle filters outperform the optimal linear (i.e., Wiener) filter, both by obtaining better estimates and by providing error bars. We then relax a number of our model assumptions to incorporate nonlinear saturation of the fluorescence signal, as well external stimulus and spike history dependence (e.g., refractoriness) of the spike trains. Using both simulations and in vitro fluorescence observations, we demonstrate temporal superresolution by inferring when within a frame each spike occurs. Furthermore, the model parameters may be estimated using expectation maximization with only a very limited amount of data (e.g., ∼5-10 s or 5-40 spikes), without the requirement of any simultaneous electrophysiology or imaging experiments. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

 abstract = {Calcium imaging for observing spiking activity from large populations of neurons are quickly gaining popularity. While the raw data are fluorescence movies, the underlying spike trains are of interest. This work presents a fast non-negative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train for each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm is fast enough that even when imaging over 100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real-time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

 abstract = {The "mind-brain supervenience" conjecture suggests that all mental properties are derived from the physical properties of the brain. To address the question of whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience hypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified version of supervenience (called $\epsilon$-supervenience) that is amenable to experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided determination of $\epsilon$-supervenience. The physical property of the brain employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the brain-graph or connectome). $\epsilon$-supervenience allows us to determine whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to within any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the relationship between the two. This may provide further motivation for cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.},

@article{Vogelstein2013,
 abstract = {This manuscript considers the following graph classification question: Given a collection of graphs and associated classes, how can one predict the class of a newly observed graph? To address this question, we propose a statistical model for graph/class pairs. This model naturally leads to a set of estimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or signal-subgraph, defined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between the classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal and efficient, but which differ by their assumption about the coherency of the signal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges stick together around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best estimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but also the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a contemporary neuroscience question: Can we classify connectomes (brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better than all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates that even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of training samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of salt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions. {\textcopyright} 1979-2012 IEEE.},

Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.},

Several hundred candidate peptides were identified through this method, providing challenges for choosing and validating the small number of peptides that might prove diagnostically useful. To accomplish this validation, we used 2D chromatography coupled with SRM of candidate peptides. We applied this approach, called sequential analysis of fractionated eluates by SRM (SAFE-SRM), to plasma from cancer patients and discovered two peptides encoded by the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIA) gene whose abundance was increased in the plasma of ovarian cancer patients. At optimal thresholds, elevated levels of at least one of these two peptides was detected in 43 (68.3{\%}) of 63 women with ovarian cancer but in none of 50 healthy controls. In addition to providing a potential biomarker for ovarian cancer, this approach is generally applicable to the discovery of peptides characteristic of various disease states.},

 abstract = {Sparse matrix multiplication is traditionally performed in memory and scales to large matrices using the distributed memory of multiple nodes. In contrast, we scale sparse matrix multiplication beyond memory capacity by implementing sparse matrix dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) in a semi-external memory (SEM) fashion; i.e., we keep the sparse matrix on commodity SSDs and dense matrices in memory. Our SEM-SpMM incorporates many in-memory optimizations for large power-law graphs. It outperforms the in-memory implementations of Trilinos and Intel MKL and scales to billion-node graphs, far beyond the limitations of memory. Furthermore, on a single large parallel machine, our SEM-SpMM operates as fast as the distributed implementations of Trilinos using five times as much processing power. We also run our implementation in memory (IM-SpMM) to quantify the overhead of keeping data on SSDs. SEM-SpMM achieves almost 100 percent performance of IM-SpMM on graphs when the dense matrix has more than four columns; it achieves at least 65 percent performance of IM-SpMM on all inputs. We apply our SpMM to three important data analysis tasks - PageRank, eigensolving, and non-negative matrix factorization - and show that our SEM implementations significantly advance the state of the art.},
