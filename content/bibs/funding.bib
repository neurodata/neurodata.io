respiratory distress, generating artificial datasets using generative adversarial networks to asses 
performance of methods when 'ground truth' is known, applying the best methods to analyze the effect 
of the target drugs on the outcomes of COVID-19 patients across hospital systems, and using the results 
to evaluate the potential of these drugs and suggest guidelines for clinical trials.},
