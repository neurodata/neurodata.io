	abstract = {Graphs are quickly emerging as a leading abstraction for the representation of data. One important application domain originates from an emerging discipline called 'connectomics'. Connectomics studies the brain as a graph; vertices correspond to neurons (or collections thereof) and edges correspond to structural or functional connections between them. To explore the variability of connectomes - to address both basic science questions regarding the structure of the brain, and medical health questions about psychiatry and neurology - one can study the topological properties of these brain-graphs. We define multivariate glocal graph invariants: these are features of the graph that capture various local and global topological properties of the graphs. We show that the collection of features can collectively be computed via a combination of daisy-chaining, sparse matrix representation and computations, and efficient approximations. Our custom open-source Python package serves as a back-end to a Web-service that we have created to enable researchers to upload graphs, and download the corresponding invariants in a number of different formats. Moreover, we built this package to support distributed processing on multicore machines. This is therefore an enabling technology for network science, lowering the barrier of entry by providing tools to biologists and analysts who otherwise lack these capabilities. As a demonstration, we run our code on 120 brain-graphs, each with approximately 16M vertices and up to 90M edges. © 2013 IEEE.}

Recent efforts demonstrating variance in functional brain organization within and between individuals shows a need for improving reproducibility of functional parcellations without long scan times. We apply bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, to the problem of improving reproducibility in functional parcellation. We use two large datasets to demonstrate that compared to a standard clustering framework, bagging improves the reproducibility and test-retest reliability of both cortical and subcortical functional parcellations across a range of sites, scanners, samples, scan lengths, and clustering parameters. With as little as six minutes of scan time bagging creates more reproducible parcellations than standard approaches with twice as much data. This suggests bagging may be a key method for improving functional parcellation and bringing functional neuroimaging-based measurement closer to clinical impact.},

We propose a multiscale dictio- nary learning model, which expresses the conditional response density as a convex combination of dictionary densities, with the densities used and their weights de- pendent on the path through a tree decomposition of the feature space. Afast graph partitioning algorithm is applied to obtain the tree decomposition, with Bayesian methods then used to adaptively prune and average over different sub-trees in a soft probabilistic manner. The algorithm scales efficiently to approximately one million features. State of the art predictive performance is demonstrated for toy examples and two neuroscience applications including up to a million features. 1},

We store all our data on the AWS object store S3 to limit our deployment costs. S3 serves as our base-tier of storage. Redis, an in-memory key-value engine, is used as our caching tier. The data is dynamically moved between the different storage tiers based on user access. All programming interfaces to this system are RESTful web-services.

Thisarises when models are larger than memory, but also systematically when models aredeployed on low-resource devices in the Internet of Things or run as cloud microserviceswhere resources are allocated on demand. Block-Aligned Serialized Trees (BLOCKSET)introduce the concept of selective access for random forests and gradient boostedtrees in which only the parts of the model needed for inference are deserialized andloaded into memory. BLOCKSET combines concepts from external memory algorithms anddata-parallel layouts of random forests that maximize I/O-density for in-memory models.Using principles from external memory algorithms, we block-align the serializationformat in order to minimize the number of I/Os. For gradient boosted trees, this resultsin a more than five time reduction in inference latency over layouts that do not performselective access and a 2 times latency reduction over techniques that are selective,but do not encode I/O block boundaries in the layout.},

	abstract = {Random Forest (RF) remains one of the most widely used general purpose classification methods. Two recent largescale empirical studies demonstrated it to be the best overall classification method among a variety of methods evaluated. One of its main limitations, however, is that it is restricted to only axis-aligned recursive partitions of the feature space. Consequently, RF is particularly sensitive to the orientation of the data. Several studies have proposed "oblique" decision forest methods to address this limitation. However, these methods either have a time and space complexity significantly greater than RF, are sensitive to unit and scale, or empirically do not perform as well as RF on real data. One promising oblique method that was proposed alongside the canonical RF method, called Forest-RC (F-RC), has not received as much attention by the community. Despite it being just as old as RF, virtually no studies exist investigating its theoretical or empirical performance. In this work, we demonstrate that F-RC empirically outperforms RF and another recently proposed oblique method called Random Rotation Random Forest, while approximately maintaining the same computational complexity. Furthermore, a variant of F-RC which rank transforms the data prior to learning is especially invariant to affine transformations and robust to data corruption. Open source code is available.},

	abstract = {The CLARITY method renders brains optically transparent to enable high-resolution imaging in the structurally intact brain. Anatomically annotating CLARITY brains is necessary for discovering which regions contain signals of interest. Manually annotating whole-brain, terabyte CLARITY images is difficult, time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Automatically registering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution, but is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and subsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus compounding inter-subject anatomical variability. Additionally, the signal in CLARITY images arises from various biochemical contrast agents which only sparsely label brain structures. This sparse labeling challenges the most commonly used registration algorithms that need to match image histogram statistics to the more densely labeled histological brain atlases. The standard method is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically generates an average template as an intermediate registration target. We determined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to the Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram statistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM) for registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and learns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using Mask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the standard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM pipelines developed here provide a fast automated way to anatomically annotate CLARITY images. Our code is available as open source software at http://NeuroData.io.},

The general approach for speeding up an implementation in R is to implement the algorithms in C or FORTRAN and provide an R wrapper. FlashR takes a different approach: it executes R code in parallel and scales the code beyond memory capacity by utilizing solid-state drives (SSDs) automatically. It provides a small number of generalized operations (GenOps) upon which we reimplement a large number of matrix functions in the R base package. As such, FlashR parallelizes and scales existing R code with little/no modification. To reduce data movement between CPU and SSDs, FlashR evaluates matrix operations lazily, fuses operations at runtime, and uses cache-aware, two-level matrix partitioning. We evaluate FlashR on a variety of machine learning and statistics algorithms on inputs of up to four billion data points. FlashR out-of-core tracks closely the performance of FlashR in-memory. The R code for machine learning algorithms executed in FlashR outperforms the in-memory execution of H2O and Spark MLlib by a factor of 2-10 and outperforms Revolution R Open by more than an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {An open challenge problem at the forefront of modern neuroscience is to obtain a comprehensive mapping of the neural pathways that underlie human brain function; an enhanced understanding of the wiring diagram of the brain promises to lead to new breakthroughs in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. Inferring brain structure from image data, such as that obtained via electron microscopy (EM), entails solving the problem of identifying biological structures in large data volumes. Synapses, which are a key communication structure in the brain, are particularly difficult to detect due to their small size and limited contrast. Prior work in automated synapse detection has relied upon time-intensive biological preparations (post-staining, isotropic slice thicknesses) in order to simplify the problem. This paper presents VESICLE, the first known approach designed for mammalian synapse detection in anisotropic, non-post-stained data. Our methods explicitly leverage biological context, and the results exceed existing synapse detection methods in terms of accuracy and scalability. We provide two different approaches - one a deep learning classifier (VESICLE-CNN) and one a lightweight Random Forest approach (VESICLE-RF) to offer alternatives in the performance-scalability space. Addressing this synapse detection challenge enables the analysis of high-throughput imaging data soon expected to reach petabytes of data, and provide tools for more rapid estimation of brain-graphs. Finally, to facilitate community efforts, we developed tools for large-scale object detection, and demonstrated this framework to find 50,000 synapses in 60,000 m 3 (220 GB on disk) of electron microscopy data.},

This class of tool remains popular because of their interpretability and ease of use, unlike other modern machine learning methods, such as kernel machines and deep learning. Decision forests also scale well for use with large data because training and run time operations are trivially parallelizable allowing for high inference throughputs. A negative aspect of these forests, and an untenable property for many real time applications, is their high inference latency caused by the combination of large model sizes with random memory access patterns. We present memory packing techniques and a novel tree traversal method to overcome this deficiency. The result of our system is a grouping of trees into a hierarchical structure. At low levels, we pack the nodes of multiple trees into contiguous memory blocks so that each memory access fetches data for multiple trees. At higher levels, we use leaf cardinality to identify the most popular paths through a tree and collocate those paths in contiguous cache lines. We extend this layout with a re-ordering of the tree traversal algorithm to take advantage of the increased memory throughput provided by out-of-order execution and cache-line prefetching. Together, these optimizations increase the performance and parallel scalability of classification in ensembles by a factor of ten over an optimized C++ implementation and a popular R-language implementation.},

Thanks to recent developments in digital acquisition techniques, powerful image analysis algorithms are developed which can be useful non-invasive tools to assist in the restoration and preservation of art. In this paper we propose a semi-supervised crack detection method that can be used for high-dimensional acquisitions of paintings coming from different modalities. Our dataset consists of a recently acquired collection of images of the Ghent Altarpiece (1432), one of Northern Europe's most important art masterpieces. Our goal is to build a classifier that is able to discern crack pixels from the background consisting of non-crack pixels, making optimal use of the information that is provided by each modality. To accomplish this we employ a recently developed non-parametric Bayesian classifier, that uses tensor factorizations to characterize any conditional probability. A prior is placed on the parameters of the factorization such that every possible interaction between predictors is allowed while still identifying a sparse subset among these predictors. The proposed Bayesian classifier, which we will refer to as conditional Bayesian tensor factorization or CBTF, is assessed by visually comparing classification results with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Together with the curse of dimensionality, nonlinear dependencies in large data sets persist as major challenges in data mining tasks. A reliable way to accurately preserve nonlinear structure is to compute geodesic distances between data points. Manifold learning methods, such as Isomap, aim to preserve geodesic distances in a Riemannian manifold. However, as manifold learning algorithms operate on the ambient dimensionality of the data, the essential step of geodesic distance computation is sensitive to high-dimensional noise. Therefore, a direct application of these algorithms to high-dimensional, noisy data often yields unsatisfactory results and does not accurately capture nonlinear structure.We propose an unsupervised random forest approach called geodesic forests (GF) to geodesic distance estimation in linear and nonlinear manifolds with noise. GF operates on low-dimensional sparse linear combinations of features, rather than the full observed dimensionality. To choose the optimal split in a computationally efficient fashion, we developed Fast-BIC, a fast Bayesian Information Criterion statistic for Gaussian mixture models.We additionally propose geodesic precision and geodesic recall as novel evaluation metrics that quantify how well the geodesic distances of a latent manifold are preserved. Empirical results on simulated and real data demonstrate that GF is robust to high-dimensional noise, whereas other methods, such as Isomap, UMAP, and FLANN, quickly deteriorate in such settings. Notably, GF is able to estimate geodesic distances better than other approaches on a real connectome dataset.},

We extend previous Bayesian nonparametric models of neural spiking to jointly detect and cluster neurons using a Gamma process model. Importantly, we develop an online approximate inference scheme enabling real-time analysis, with performance exceeding the previous state-of-the-art. Via exploratory data analysis-using data with partial ground truth as well as two novel data sets-we find several features of our model collectively contribute to our improved performance including: (i) accounting for colored noise, (ii) detecting overlapping spikes, (iii) tracking waveform dynamics, and (iv) using multiple channels.

We assume a stochastic block model (SBM) where neurons belong together if they connect to neurons of other groups according to the same probability distributions. Following adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) of the SBM graph, we derive the number of classes and assign each neuron to a class with a Gaussian mixture model-based expectation-maximization (EM) clustering algorithm. To improve accuracy, we introduce a simple variation using random hierarchical agglomerative clustering to initialize the EM algorithm and picking the best solution over multiple EM restarts. We test this procedure on a large (n   212 - 215 neurons), sparse, biologically inspired connectome with eight neuron classes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is broadly stable to the choice of dimensional embedding and scales extremely well as the number of neurons in the network increases. Clustering accuracy is robust to variations in model parameters and highly tolerant to simulated experimental noise, achieving perfect classifications with up to 40},

	abstract = {Decision forests are widely used for classification and regression tasks. A lesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a proximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced kernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and properties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced by decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF), which induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node proximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel, and prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both discrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it would outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate that KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across a diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing settings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides feature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions, unlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this work demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and more interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional wisdom of the trade-off between the two.},

The standard method for k-sample testing in biomedicine is Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), despite that it depends on strong, and often unsuitable, parametric assumptions. Moreover, independence testing and k-sample testing are closely related, and several universally consistent high-dimensional independence tests such as distance correlation (Dcorr) and Hilbert-Schmidt-Independence-Criterion (Hsic) enjoy solid theoretical and empirical properties. In this paper, we prove that independence tests achieve universally consistent k-sample testing and that k-sample statistics such as Energy and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) are precisely equivalent to Dcorr. An empirical evaluation of nonparametric independence tests showed that they generally perform better than the popular MANOVA test, even in Gaussian distributed scenarios. The evaluation included several popular independence statistics and covered a comprehensive set of simulations. Additionally, the testing approach was extended to perform multiway and multilevel tests, which were demonstrated in a simulated study as well as a real-world fMRI brain scans with a set of attributes.},

Particularly, the everted telencephalon of ray-finned fishes shows a noticeably different morphology to the evaginated telencephalon of non-ray-finned fishes and other vertebrates. This makes the comparison between the different parts of the telencephalon of ray-finned fishes and other vertebrates difficult. Based on neuroanatomical, neurochemical and connectional data no consensus on the subdivisions of the adult telencephalon of ray-finned fishes and their relation to nuclei in the telencephalon of other vertebrates has been reached yet. For tetrapods, comparative expression pattern analysis of homologous developmental genes has been a successful approach to clarify homologies between different parts of the telencephalon. In the larval zebrafish, subdivisions of the subpallium have been proposed using conserved developmental genes expression. In this study, we investigate the subdivisions of the adult zebrafish telencephalon by analyzing the expression pattern of conserved molecular marker genes. We identify the boundary between the pallium and subpallium based on the complementary expression of dlx2a, dlx5a in the subpallium and tbr1, neurod in the pallium. Furthermore, combinatorial expression of Isl, nkx2.1b, lhx1b, tbr1, eomesa, emx1, emx2 and emx3 identifies striatal-like, pallidal-like and septal-like subdivisions within the subpallium. In contrast to previous models, we propose that the striatum and pallidum are stretched along the rostro-caudal axis of the telencephalon. Further, the septal nuclei derive from both the pallium and subpallium. On this basis, we present a new model for the subdivisions of the subpallium in teleost fish.},

In Drosophila, neurons producing the homologous neuropeptide hugin regulate feeding and locomotion in a similar manner. Here, we use EM-based reconstruction to generate the entire connectome of hugin-producing neurons in the Drosophila larval CNS. We demonstrate that hugin neurons use synaptic transmission in addition to peptidergic neuromodulation and identify acetylcholine as a key transmitter. Hugin neuropeptide and acetylcholine are both necessary for the regulatory effect on feeding. We further show that subtypes of hugin neurons connect chemosensory to endocrine system by combinations of synaptic and peptide-receptor connections. Targets include endocrine neurons producing DH44, a CRH-like peptide, and insulin-like peptides. Homologs of these peptides are likewise downstream of neuromedinU, revealing striking parallels in flies and mammals. We propose that hugin neurons are part of an ancient physiological control system that has been conserved at functional and molecular level.</p>},

We found an intersegmental chain of synaptically connected neurons, alternating excitatory and inhibitory, necessary for wave propagation and active in phase with the wave. The excitatory neurons (A27h) are premotor and necessary only for forward locomotion, and are modulated by stretch receptors and descending inputs. The inhibitory neurons (GDL) are necessary for both forward and backward locomotion, suggestive of different yet coupled central pattern generators, and its inhibition is necessary for wave propagation. The circuit structure and functional imaging indicated that the commands to contract one segment promote the relaxation of the next segment, revealing a mechanism for wave propagation in peristaltic locomotion.},

Computational simulations indicate that the observed subcellular targeting enables control over the nonlinear integration of synaptic input or the initiation and backpropagation of action potentials in a branch-selective manner.

Here we show that single presynaptic axons form multiple, spatially clustered inputs onto the distal, but not proximal, dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These compound connections exhibit ultrastructural features indicative of strong synapses and occur much more commonly in entorhinal than in thalamic afferents. Computational simulations revealed that compound connections depolarize dendrites in a biophysically efficient manner, owing to their inherent spatiotemporal clustering.

Together, these studies reveal that, early in sensory processing, (1) reciprocally connected feedforward inhibitory interneurons implement behavioral choice, (2) local feedback disinhibition provides positive feedback that consolidates and maintains the chosen behavior, and (3) lateral disinhibition promotes sequence transitions. The combination of these interconnected circuit motifs can implement both behavior selection and the serial organization of behaviors into a sequence.},

	abstract = {The CLARITY method renders brains optically transparent to enable high-resolution imaging in the structurally intact brain. Anatomically annotating CLARITY brains is necessary for discovering which regions contain signals of interest. Manually annotating whole-brain, terabyte CLARITY images is difficult, time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Automatically registering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution, but is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and subsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus compounding inter-subject anatomical variability. Additionally, the signal in CLARITY images arises from various biochemical contrast agents which only sparsely label brain structures. This sparse labeling challenges the most commonly used registration algorithms that need to match image histogram statistics to the more densely labeled histological brain atlases. The standard method is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically generates an average template as an intermediate registration target. We determined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to the Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram statistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM) for registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and learns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using Mask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the standard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM pipelines developed here provide a fast automated way to anatomically annotate CLARITY images. Our code is available as open source software at http://NeuroData.io.},

Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property–the preferred stimulus orientation–of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could not be rejected.},

Combining information from several modalities is essential for the selection of appropriate actions. Key to understanding multimodal computations is determining the structural patterns of multimodal convergence and how these patterns contribute to behaviour. Modalities could converge early, late or at multiple levels in the sensory processing hierarchy. Here we show that combining mechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically enhances the selection of the fastest mode of escape locomotion in Drosophila larvae. In an electron microscopy volume that spans the entire insect nervous system, we reconstructed the multisensory circuit supporting the synergy, spanning multiple levels of the sensory processing hierarchy. The wiring diagram revealed a complex multilevel multimodal convergence architecture. Using behavioural and physiological studies, we identified functionally connected circuit nodes that trigger the fastest locomotor mode, and others that facilitate it, and we provide evidence that multiple levels of multimodal integration contribute to escape mode selection. We propose that the multilevel multimodal convergence architecture may be a general feature of multisensory circuits enabling complex input-output functions and selective tuning to ecologically relevant combinations of cues.},

Using brain registration across hundreds of larval zebrafish, we have built an expandable open-source atlas containing molecular labels and definitions of anatomical regions, the Z-Brain. Using this platform and immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a readout of neural activity, we have developed a system to create and contextualize whole-brain maps of stimulus- and behavior-dependent neural activity. This mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP)-mapping assay is technically simple, and data analysis is completely automated. Because MAP-mapping is performed on freely swimming fish, it is applicable to studies of nearly any stimulus or behavior. Here we demonstrate our high-throughput approach using pharmacological, visual and noxious stimuli, as well as hunting and feeding. The resultant maps outline hundreds of areas associated with behaviors.},

The library implements a variety of univariate and multivariate analyses with a modular, extendable structure well-suited to interactive exploration and analysis development. We demonstrate how these analyses find structure in large-scale neural data, including whole-brain light-sheet imaging data from fictively behaving larval zebrafish, and two-photon imaging data from behaving mouse. The analyses relate neuronal responses to sensory input and behavior, run in minutes or less and can be used on a private cluster or in the cloud. Our open-source framework thus holds promise for turning brain activity mapping efforts into biological insights.},

	abstract = {Energy statistics was proposed by Székely in the 80's inspired by the Newtonian gravitational potential from classical mechanics, and it provides a hypothesis test for equality of distributions. It was further generalized from Euclidean spaces to metric spaces of strong negative type, and more recently, a connection with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) was established. Here we consider the clustering problem from an energy statistics theory perspective, providing a precise mathematical formulation yielding a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) in the associated RKHS, thus establishing the connection with kernel methods. We show that this QCQP is equivalent to kernel k-means optimization problem once the kernel is fixed. These results imply a first principles derivation of kernel k-means from energy statistics. However, energy statistics fixes a family of standard kernels. Furthermore, we also consider a weighted version of energy statistics, making connection to graph partitioning problems. To find local optimizers of such QCQP we propose an iterative algorithm based on Hartigan's method, which in this case has the same computational cost as kernel k-means algorithm, based on Lloyd's heuristic, but usually with better clustering quality. We provide carefully designed numerical experiments showing the superiority of the proposed method compared to kernel k-means, spectral clustering, standard k-means, and Gaussian mixture models in a variety of settings.},

Electron microscopy (EM) is the definitive means to recognize and measure individual synaptic contacts, but EM has only limited abilities to measure the molecular composition of synapses. This report describes conjugate array tomography (AT), a volumetric imaging method that integrates immunofluorescence and EM imaging modalities in voxel-conjugate fashion.

In the last couple of decades, several experimental paradigms have arisen that are poised to finally begin studying neuroanatomy in a high-throughput fashion. In 2005, the term connectome was coined independently by Patric Hagmann and Olaf Sporns, to describe the complete set of neural connections in a brain. Interestingly, both usages seemed to be referring to using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to study human brain networks. Shortly thereafter, Narayanan "Bobby" Kasthuri and Jeff Lichtman published an article suggesting that "connectome" should refer to connections between neurons, which one can infer using Electron Microscopy (EM) and fluorescence microscopy (e.g., brainbow animals). "Projectome", they suggested, is more appropriate for MRI based studies. Yet, the word connectome stuck, and now refers to essentially any neuroscientific investigation of the relationship between (collections of) neurons, be they functional or structural.},

	abstract = {Graph matching - aligning a pair of graphs to minimize their edge disagreements - has received wide-spread attention from both theoretical and applied communities over the past several decades, including combinatorics, computer vision, and connectomics. Its attention can be partially attributed to its computational difficulty. Although many heuristics have previously been proposed in the literature to approximately solve graph matching, very few have any theoretical support for their performance. A common technique is to relax the discrete problem to a continuous problem, therefore enabling practitioners to bring gradient-descent-type algorithms to bear. We prove that an indefinite relaxation (when solved exactly) almost always discovers the optimal permutation, while a common convex relaxation almost always fails to discover the optimal permutation. These theoretical results suggest that initializing the indefinite algorithm with the convex optimum might yield improved practical performance. Indeed, experimental results illuminate and corroborate these theoretical findings, demonstrating that excellent results are achieved in both benchmark and real data problems by amalgamating the two approaches.},

Specifically, a joint nearest-neighbor graph is built for all modalities.

Although the observations here are fluorescence movies, the signals of interest - spike trains and/or time varying intracellular calcium concentrations - are hidden. Inferring these hidden signals is often problematic due to noise, nonlinearities, slow imaging rate, and unknown biophysical parameters. We overcome these difficulties by developing sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters) based on biophysical models of spiking, calcium dynamics, and fluorescence. We show that even in simple cases, the particle filters outperform the optimal linear (i.e., Wiener) filter, both by obtaining better estimates and by providing error bars. We then relax a number of our model assumptions to incorporate nonlinear saturation of the fluorescence signal, as well external stimulus and spike history dependence (e.g., refractoriness) of the spike trains. Using both simulations and in vitro fluorescence observations, we demonstrate temporal superresolution by inferring when within a frame each spike occurs. Furthermore, the model parameters may be estimated using expectation maximization with only a very limited amount of data (e.g., ∼5-10 s or 5-40 spikes), without the requirement of any simultaneous electrophysiology or imaging experiments. © 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

In contrast, we scale sparse matrix multiplication beyond memory capacity by implementing sparse matrix dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) in a semi-external memory (SEM) fashion; i.e., we keep the sparse matrix on commodity SSDs and dense matrices in memory. Our SEM-SpMM incorporates many in-memory optimizations for large power-law graphs. It outperforms the in-memory implementations of Trilinos and Intel MKL and scales to billion-node graphs, far beyond the limitations of memory. Furthermore, on a single large parallel machine, our SEM-SpMM operates as fast as the distributed implementations of Trilinos using five times as much processing power. We also run our implementation in memory (IM-SpMM) to quantify the overhead of keeping data on SSDs. SEM-SpMM achieves almost 100 percent performance of IM-SpMM on graphs when the dense matrix has more than four columns; it achieves at least 65 percent performance of IM-SpMM on all inputs. We apply our SpMM to three important data analysis tasks - PageRank, eigensolving, and non-negative matrix factorization - and show that our SEM implementations significantly advance the state of the art.},

One major bottleneck is the testing process: because the null distribution of distance correlation depends on the underlying random variables and metric choice, it typically requires a permutation test to estimate the null and compute the p-value, which is very costly for large amount of data. To overcome the difficulty, in this paper we propose a chi-square test for distance correlation. Method-wise, the chi-square test is non-parametric, extremely fast, and applicable to bias-corrected distance correlation using any strong negative type metric or characteristic kernel. The test exhibits a similar testing power as the standard permutation test, and can be utilized for K-sample and partial testing. Theory-wise, we show that the underlying chi-square distribution well approximates and dominates the limiting null distribution in upper tail, prove the chi-square test can be valid and universally consistent for testing independence, and establish a testing power inequality with respect to the permutation test.},

However, the imaging scale required to comprehensively reconstruct these structures is more than ten orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial extents occupied by networks of interconnected neurons, some of which span nearly the entire brain. Difficulties in generating and handling data for large volumes at nanoscale resolution have thus restricted vertebrate studies to fragments of circuits. These efforts were recently transformed by advances in computing, sample handling, imaging techniques, but high-resolution examination of entire brains remains a challenge. Here, we present ssEM data for the complete brain of a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 5.5 days post-fertilization. Our approach utilizes multiple rounds of targeted imaging at different scales to reduce acquisition time and data management requirements. The resulting dataset can be analysed to reconstruct neuronal processes, permitting us to survey all myelinated axons (the projectome). These reconstructions enable precise investigations of neuronal morphology, which reveal remarkable bilateral symmetry in myelinated reticulospinal and lateral line afferent axons. We further set the stage for whole-brain structure-function comparisons by co-registering functional reference atlases and in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy data from the same specimen. All obtained images and reconstructions are provided as an open-access resource.},

For example, in connectomic applications, interconnections among brain regions are collected for each patient under study, motivating statistical models which can flexibly characterize the probabilistic generative mechanism underlying these network-valued data. Available models for a single network are not designed specifically for inference on the entire probability mass function of a network-valued random variable and therefore lack flexibility in characterizing the distribution of relevant topological structures. We propose a flexible Bayesian nonparametric approach for modeling the population distribution of network-valued data. The joint distribution of the edges is defined via a mixture model that reduces dimensionality and efficiently incorporates network information within each mixture component by leveraging latent space representations. The formulation leads to an efficient Gibbs sampler and provides simple and coherent strategies for inference and goodness-of-fit assessments. We provide theoretical results on the flexibility of our model and illustrate improved performance—compared to state-of-the-art models—in simulations and application to human brain networks.

	abstract = {Statistical inference on graphs is a burgeoning field in the applied and theoretical statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of science, engineering, business, etc. In many applications, we are faced with the reality of errorfully observed graphs. That is, the existence of an edge between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this article, we consider a graph G = (V, E). We wish to perform an inference task—the inference task considered here is “vertex classification,” that is, given a vertex v with unknown label Y(v), we want to infer the label for v based on the graph G and the given labels for some set of vertices in G not containing v. However, we do not observe G; rather, for each potential edge (Formula presented.) we observe an “edge feature” that we use to classify uv as edge/not-edge. Thus, we errorfully observe G when we observe the graph (Formula presented.) as the edges in (Formula presented.) arise from the classifications of the “edge features,” and are expected to be errorful. Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge features we observe—more informative edge features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality trade-off for a simple class of random graphs model, namely, the stochastic blockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for classifying v and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating points for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the issue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize performance for the ultimate inference task. Finally, we investigate the quantity/quality tradeoff for errorful observations of the C. elegans connectome graph.},

Graph similarity with given node correspondence, i.e., the detection of changes in the connectivity of graphs, arises in numerous settings. In this work, we formally state the axioms and desired properties of the graph similarity functions, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect crucial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose DELTACON, a principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that assesses the similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g., employees of a company, customers of a mobile carrier). In conjunction, we propose DELTACON-ATTR, a related approach that enables attribution of change or dissimilarity to responsible nodes and edges. Experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over existing similarity measures. Finally, we employ DELTACON and DELTACON-ATTR on real applications: (a) we classify people to groups of high and low creativity based on their brain connectivity graphs, (b) do temporal anomaly detection in the who-emails-whom Enron graph and find the top culprits for the changes in the temporal corporate email graph, and (c) recover pairs of test-retest large brain scans (∼17M edges, up to 90M edges) for 21 subjects.},

For optimal individual subject characterization, specific acquisition and analysis features need to be identified that maximize interindividual variability while concomitantly minimizing intra-subject variability. We delineate the effect of various acquisition parameters (length of acquisition, sampling frequency) and analysis methods (time course extraction, region of interest parcellation, and thresholding of connectivity-derived network graphs) on characterizing individual subject differentiation. We utilize a non-parametric statistical metric that quantifies the degree to which a parameter set allows this individual subject differentiation by both maximizing interindividual variance and minimizing intra-individual variance. We apply this metric to analysis of four publicly available test-retest resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data sets. We find that for the question of maximizing individual differentiation, (i) for increasing sampling, there is a relative tradeoff between increased sampling frequency and increased acquisition time; (ii) for the sizes of the interrogated data sets, only 3-4 min of acquisition time was sufficient to maximally differentiate each subject with an algorithm that utilized no a priori information regarding subject identification; and (iii) brain regions that most contribute to this individual subject characterization lie in the default mode, attention, and executive control networks. These findings may guide optimal rs-fMRI experiment design and may elucidate the neural bases for subject-to-subject differences.},

A specific genometype represents the genomes in the population conferring a specific level of genetic risk for a specified disease. Using this concept, we estimated the maximum capacity of whole-genome sequencing to identify individuals at clinically significant risk for 24 different diseases. Our estimates were derived from the analysis of large numbers of monozygotic twin pairs; twins of a pair share the same genometype and therefore identical genetic risk factors. Our analyses indicate that (i) for 23 of the 24 diseases, most of the individuals will receive negative test results; (ii) these negative test results will, in general, not be very informative, because the risk of developing 19 of the 24 diseases in those who test negative will still be, at minimum, 50 to 80},

Recent advances in high-throughput serial section electron microscopy (EM) have produced massive 3D image volumes of nanoscale brain tissue for the first time. The resolution of EM allows for individual neurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Recovering neuronal networks by manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is unmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image processing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the solution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse identification). In this manuscript we present the first fully-automated images-to-graphs pipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue and produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall performance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a metric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We evaluate a set of algorithms and parameters, searching possible operating points to identify the best available brain graph for our assessment metric. Finally, we deploy a reference end-to-end version of the pipeline on a large, publicly available data set. This provides a baseline result and framework for community analysis and future algorithm development and testing. All code and data derivatives have been made publicly available in support of eventually unlocking new biofidelic computational primitives and understanding of neuropathologies.},

Recently-introduced calcium fluorescent imaging methods permit experimentalists to observe network activity in large popu lations of neurons, but these techniques provide only indirect observations of neural spike trains, with limited time resolution and signal quality. In this work we present a Bayesian approach for inferring neural circuitry given this type of imaging data. We model the network activity in terms of a collec tion of coupled hidden Markov chains, with each chain corresponding to a single neuron in the network and the coupling between the chains reflecting the network's connectivity matrix. We derive a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for fitting the model parameters; to obtain the suf ficient statistics in a computationally-efficient manner, we introduce a spe cialized blockwise-Gibbs algorithm for sampling from the joint activity of all observed neurons given the observed fluorescence data. We perform large scale simulations of randomly connected neuronal networks with biophysi cally realistic parameters and find that the proposed methods can accurately infer the connectivity in these networks given reasonable experimental and computational constraints. In addition, the estimation accuracy may be im proved significantly by incorporating prior knowledge about the sparseness of connectivity in the network, via standard L penalization methods.},

Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical.},

A potential clinical application is monitoring body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), recurrent, injurious behaviors directed toward the body, such as nail biting and hair pulling, which are often misdiagnosed and undertreated. Here, we demonstrate that including thermal sensors achieves higher accuracy in position tracking when compared against inertial measurement unit and proximity sensor data alone. Our Tingle device distinguished between behaviors from six locations on the head across 39 adult participants, with high AUROC values (best was back of the head: median (1.0), median absolute deviation (0.0); worst was on the cheek: median (0.93), median absolute deviation (0.09)).

In this paper, we prove that the (suitably modified) adjacency-spectral partitioning procedure, requiring only an upper bound on the rank of the communication probability matrix, is consistent. Indeed, this result demonstrates a robustness to model mis-specification; an overestimate of the rank may impose a moderate performance penalty, but the procedure is still consistent.

	abstract = {Neuronal responses during sensory processing are influenced by both the organization of intracortical connections and the statistical features of sensory stimuli. How these intrinsic and extrinsic factors govern the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations is unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, we investigated the dependencies between synaptic connectivity, feature selectivity and network activity in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in mouse visual cortex. In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways.},

However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Here we demonstrate the use of synchrotron X-ray microtomography (μCT) for producing mesoscale (1∼μ m^3) resolution brain maps from millimeter-scale volumes of mouse brain. We introduce a pipeline for μCT-based brain mapping that combines methods for sample preparation, imaging, automated segmentation of image volumes into cells and blood vessels, and statistical analysis of the resulting brain structures. Our results demonstrate that X-ray tomography promises rapid quantification of large brain volumes, complementing other brain mapping and connectomics efforts.},

In addition, integration of human papillomavirus DNA has been identified at a fragile site (FRA3B) within the FHIT locus in cervical cancer. These observations motivated us to evaluate FHIT mRNA and protein expression in cervical cancer cell lines, primary cervical carcinomas, and normal tissues.

This work presents a fast non-negative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train for each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm is fast enough that even when imaging over 100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real-time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

Specifically, we propose a modified version of supervenience (called ϵ-supervenience) that is amenable to experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided determination of ϵ-supervenience. The physical property of the brain employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the brain-graph or connectome). ϵ-supervenience allows us to determine whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to within any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the relationship between the two. This may provide further motivation for cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.},

By leveraging dimensionality reduction algorithms, high-dimensional fMRI data can be represented in a low-dimensional space to characterize individual features. Such a representative space encodes the functional architecture of individuals and enables the observation of functional changes across time. However, determining comparable functional features across individuals in resting-state fMRI in a way that simultaneously preserves individual-specific connectivity structure can be challenging. In this work we propose scalable joint embedding to simultaneously embed multiple individual brain connectomes within a common space that allows individual representations across datasets to be aligned. Using Human Connectome Project data, we evaluated the joint embedding approach by comparing it to the previously established orthonormal alignment model. Alignment using joint embedding substantially increased the similarity of functional representations across individuals while simultaneously capturing their distinct profiles, allowing individuals to be more discriminable from each other. Additionally, we demonstrated that the common space established using resting-state fMRI provides a better overlap of task-activation across participants. Finally, in a more challenging scenario - alignment across a lifespan cohort aged from 6 to 85 - joint embedding provided a better prediction of age (r2 = 0.65) than the prior alignment model. It facilitated the characterization of functional trajectories across lifespan. Overall, these analyses establish that joint embedding can simultaneously capture individual neural representations in a common connectivity space aligning functional data across participants and populations and preserve individual specificity.},

Here, we develop a function-based method for cross-species alignment that enables the quantification of homologous regions between humans and rhesus macaques, even when their location is decoupled from anatomical landmarks. Critically, we find cross-species similarity in functional organization reflects a gradient of evolutionary change that decreases from unimodal systems and culminates with the most pronounced changes in posterior regions of the default mode network (angular gyrus, posterior cingulate and middle temporal cortices). Our findings suggest that the establishment of the default mode network, as the apex of a cognitive hierarchy, has changed in a complex manner during human evolution – even within subnetworks},

We mitigate both kinds of issues by proposing an M-estimator for Reduced-rank System IDentification (Mr. Sid). A combination of low-rank approximations, ℓ1 and ℓ2 penalties, and some numerical linear algebra tricks, yields an estimator that is computationally efficient and numerically stable. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a variety of problems. In particular, we demonstrate that Mr. Sid can accurately estimate spatial filters, connectivity graphs, and time-courses from native resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Mr. Sid therefore enables big time-series data to be analyzed using standard methods, readying the field for further generalizations including nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models.},

Measurements of these graphs can reveal the underlying structure of these interactions, which provides insight into the systems that generated the graphs.

We utilize these node covariates to help uncover latent communities in a graph, using a modification of spectral clustering. Statistical guarantees are provided under a joint mixture model that we call the node-contextualized stochastic blockmodel, including a bound on the mis-clustering rate. The bound is used to derive conditions for achieving perfect clustering. For most simulated cases, covariate-assisted spectral clustering yields results superior to regularized spectral clustering without node covariates and to an adaptation of canonical correlation analysis. We apply our clustering method to large brain graphs derived from diffusion MRI data, using the node locations or neurological region membership as covariates. In both cases, covariate-assisted spectral clustering yields clusters that are easier to interpret neurologically.},

	abstract = {There is a consensus that substantial heterogeneity underlies the neurobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As such, it has become increasingly clear that a dissection of variation at the molecular, cellular, and brain network domains is a prerequisite for identifying biomarkers. Neuroimaging has been widely used to characterize atypical brain patterns in ASD, although findings have varied across studies. This is due, at least in part, to a failure to account for neurobiological heterogeneity. Here, we summarize emerging data-driven efforts to delineate more homogeneous ASD subgroups at the level of brain structure and function—that is, neurosubtyping. We break this pursuit into key methodological steps: the selection of diagnostic samples, neuroimaging features, algorithms, and validation approaches. Although preliminary and methodologically diverse, current studies generally agree that at least 2 to 4 distinct ASD neurosubtypes may exist. Their identification improved symptom prediction and diagnostic label accuracy above and beyond group average comparisons. Yet, this nascent literature has shed light onto challenges and gaps. These include 1) the need for wider and more deeply transdiagnostic samples collected while minimizing artifacts (e.g., head motion), 2) quantitative and unbiased methods for feature selection and multimodal fusion, 3) greater emphasis on algorithms’ ability to capture hybrid dimensional and categorical models of ASD, and 4) systematic independent replications and validations that integrate different units of analyses across multiple scales. Solutions aimed to address these challenges and gaps are discussed for future avenues leading toward a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying ASD heterogeneity},

	abstract = {Together with the curse of dimensionality, nonlinear dependencies in large data sets persist as major challenges in data mining tasks. A reliable way to accurately preserve nonlinear structure is to compute geodesic distances between data points. Manifold learning methods, such as Isomap, aim to preserve geodesic distances in a Riemannian manifold. However, as manifold learning algorithms operate on the ambient dimensionality of the data, the essential step of geodesic distance computation is sensitive to high-dimensional noise. Therefore, a direct application of these algorithms to high-dimensional, noisy data often yields unsatisfactory results and does not accurately capture nonlinear structure.We propose an unsupervised random forest approach called geodesic forests (GF) to geodesic distance estimation in linear and nonlinear manifolds with noise. GF operates on low-dimensional sparse linear combinations of features, rather than the full observed dimensionality. To choose the optimal split in a computationally efficient fashion, we developed Fast-BIC, a fast Bayesian Information Criterion statistic for Gaussian mixture models.We additionally propose geodesic precision and geodesic recall as novel evaluation metrics that quantify how well the geodesic distances of a latent manifold are preserved. Empirical results on simulated and real data demonstrate that GF is robust to high-dimensional noise, whereas other methods, such as Isomap, UMAP, and FLANN, quickly deteriorate in such settings. Notably, GF is able to estimate geodesic distances better than other approaches on a real connectome dataset},

This classifier represents a test vertex as a sparse combination of the vertices in the training set and uses the recovered coefficients to classify the test vertex. We prove consistency of our proposed classifier for stochastic blockmodels, and demonstrate that the sparse representation classifier can predict vertex labels with higher accuracy than adjacency spectral embedding approaches via both simulation studies and real data experiments. Our results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed vertex classifier when the model dimension is unknown.},

	abstract = {This manuscript considers the following graph classification question: Given a collection of graphs and associated classes, how can one predict the class of a newly observed graph? To address this question, we propose a statistical model for graph/class pairs. This model naturally leads to a set of estimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or signal-subgraph, defined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between the classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal and efficient, but which differ by their assumption about the coherency of the signal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges stick together around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best estimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but also the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a contemporary neuroscience question: Can we classify connectomes (brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better than all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates that even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of training samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of salt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

We focus on a particular problem from medical research, supervised multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We examine the extent to which the choice of machine learning or classification algorithm and feature extraction function impacts the performance of lesion segmentation methods. As quantitative measures derived from structural MRI are important clinical tools for research into the pathophysiology and natural history of MS, the development of automated lesion segmentation methods is an active research field. Yet, little is known about what drives performance of these methods. We evaluate the performance of automated MS lesion segmentation methods, which consist of a supervised classification algorithm composed with a feature extraction function. These feature extraction functions act on the observed T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI voxel intensities. Each MRI study has a manual lesion segmentation that we use to train and validate the supervised classification algorithms. Our main finding is that the differences in predictive performance are due more to differences in the feature vectors, rather than the machine learning or classification algorithms. Features that incorporate information from neighboring voxels in the brain were found to increase performance substantially. For lesion segmentation, we conclude that it is better to use simple, interpretable, and fast algorithms, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis, and to develop the features to improve performance.},

The chip contains 2400 silicon neurons with fully programmable and reconfigurable synaptic connectivity. Each neuron implements a discrete-time model of a single-compartment cell. The model allows for analog membrane dynamics and an arbitrary number of synaptic connections, each with tunable conductance and reversal potential. The array of silicon neurons functions as an address-event (AE) transceiver, with incoming and outgoing spikes communicated over an asynchronous event-driven digital bus. Address encoding and conflict resolution of spiking events are implemented via a randomized arbitration scheme that ensures balanced servicing of event requests across the array. Routing of events is implemented externally using dynamically programmable random-access memory that stores a postsynaptic address, the conductance, and the reversal potential of each synaptic connection. Here, we describe the silicon neuron circuits, present experimental data characterizing the 3 mm x 3 mm chip fabricated in 0.5-micron complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and demonstrate its utility by configuring the hardware to emulate a model of attractor dynamics and waves of neural activity during sleep in rat hippocampus.},

In this study, we investigated whether the asymmetry in memory saccades is dependent on body orientation in space. Thus animals performed memory saccades in four different body orientations: upright, left-side-down (LSD), right-side-down (RSD), and supine. Data in all three rhesus monkeys confirm previous observations regarding a significant upward vertical asymmetry. Saccade errors made from LSD and RSD postures were partitioned into components made along the axis of gravity and along the vertical body axis. Up/down asymmetry persisted only in body coordinates but not in gravity coordinates. However, this asymmetry was generally reduced in tilted positions. Therefore the upward bias seen in memory saccades is egocentric although orientation in space might play a modulatory role.},

These histories are written into our brain structure through the building and modification of various brain circuits. Connectal coding, by way of analogy with neural coding, is the art, study, and practice of identifying the network structures that link cognitive phenomena to individual histories.

In this work, we present a kernel-based method to establish a network for each subject using mean cortical thickness, which we refer to hereafter as the individual's network. We construct individual networks for 83 subjects, including AD patients and normal controls (NC), which are taken from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. The network edge features are used to make prediction of AD/NC through the sophisticated machine learning technology. As the number of edge features is much more than that of samples, feature selection is applied to avoid the adverse impact of high-dimensional data on the performance of classifier. We use a hybrid feature selection that combines filter and wrapper methods, and compare the performance of six different combinations of them. Finally, support vector machines are trained using the selected features. To obtain an unbiased evaluation of our method, we use a nested cross validation framework to choose the optimal hyper-parameters of classifier and evaluate the generalization of the method. We report the best accuracy of 90.4},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has unlocked unprecedented success in various domains, especially in image, text, and speech processing. These breakthroughs may hold promise for neuroscience and especially for brain-imaging investigators who start to analyze thousands of participants. However, deep learning is only beneficial if the data have nonlinear relationships and if they are exploitable at currently available sample sizes. We systematically profiled the performance of deep models, kernel models, and linear models as a function of sample size on UK Biobank brain images against established machine learning references. On MNIST and Zalando Fashion, prediction accuracy consistently improved when escalating from linear models to shallow-nonlinear models, and further improved when switching to deep-nonlinear models. The more observations were available for model training, the greater the performance gain we saw. In contrast, using structural or functional brain scans, simple linear models performed on par with more complex, highly parameterized models in age/sex prediction across increasing sample sizes. In fact, linear models kept improving as the sample size approached 10,000 participants. Our results indicate that the increase in performance of linear models with additional data does not saturate at the limit of current feasibility. Yet, nonlinearities of common brain scans remain largely inaccessible to both kernel and deep learning methods at any examined scale.}

Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers.

Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers.The Clinical and Translational Science Award Program and scientific community created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and reproducible collaborative analytics.Organized in inclusive workstreams, we created legal agreements and governance for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19 cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to democratize data access.The N3C has demonstrated that a multisite collaborative learning health network can overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure incorporating multiorganizational clinical data for COVID-19 analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19.", issn = 1527-974X},

Similar studies with rodents have been challenging because of smaller brain volumes. Using high field MRI (9.4 T) and compressed sensing, we have achieved microscopic resolution and sufficiently high throughput for rodent population studies. We generated whole brain structural MRI and diffusion connectomes for four diverse isogenic lines of mice (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, CAST/EiJ, and BTBR) at spatial resolution 20,000 times higher than human connectomes. We measured narrow sense heritability (h2) I.e. the fraction of variance explained by strains in a simple ANOVA model for volumes and scalar diffusion metrics, and estimates of residual technical error for 166 regions in each hemisphere and connectivity between the regions. Volumes of discrete brain regions had the highest mean heritability (0.71 ± 0.23 SD, n = 332), followed by fractional anisotropy (0.54 ± 0.26), radial diffusivity (0.34 ± 0.022), and axial diffusivity (0.28 ± 0.19). Connection profiles were statistically different in 280 of 322 nodes across all four strains. Nearly 150 of the connection profiles were statistically different between the C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and CAST/EiJ lines. Microscopic whole brain MRI/DTI has allowed us to identify significant heritable phenotypes in brain volume, scalar DTI metrics, and quantitative connectomes.},

We propose a general class of algorithms for parallelizing computations to dramatically speed up computation time by orders of magnitude exploiting multicore architectures. We implement our algorithm on a cloud computing platform, providing pseudo and actual code. The algorithm can be easily implemented on any multicore parallel computing resource. Some illustrations are provided to give a flavor for the gains and what becomes possible in freeing up this bottleneck.},

	abstract = {Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, and adding to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols), resulting in failures to replicate. Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroData's MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies (∼6,000 scans) from 15 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site, and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies - much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We, therefore, provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.},

	abstract = {We propose a new gradient-domain technique for processing registered EM image stacks to remove the inter-image discontinuities while preserving intra-image detail. To this end, we process the image stack by first performing anisotropic diffusion to smooth the data along the slice axis and then solving a screened-Poisson equation within each slice to re-introduce the detail. The final image stack is both continuous across the slice axis (facilitating the tracking of information between slices) and maintains sharp details within each slice (supporting automatic feature detection). To support this editing, we describe the implementation of the first multigrid solver designed for efficient gradient domain processing of large, out-of-core, voxel grids.},

They run in memory of a single machine for smaller eigenvalue problems and require the distributed memory for larger problems. In contrast, we develop an SSD-based eigensolver framework called FlashEigen, which extends Anasazi eigensolvers to SSDs, to compute eigenvalues of a graph with hundreds of millions or even billions of vertices in a single machine. FlashEigen performs sparse matrix multiplication in a semi-external memory fashion, i.e., we keep the sparse matrix on SSDs and the dense matrix in memory. We store the entire vector subspace on SSDs and reduce I/O to improve performance through caching the most recent dense matrix. Our result shows that FlashEigen is able to achieve 40},

Motivated by a thorough exploratory data analysis of the network via Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) in the adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) representation space, we introduce the latent structure model (LSM) for network modeling and inference. LSM is a generalization of the stochastic block model (SBM) and a special case of the random dot product graph (RDPG) latent position model, and is amenable to semiparametric GMM in the ASE representation space. The resulting connectome code derived via semiparametric GMM composed with ASE captures latent connectome structure and elucidates biologically relevant neuronal properties.},

	abstract = {R is one of the most popular programming languages for statistics and machine learning, but the R framework is relatively slow and unable to scale to large datasets. The general approach for speeding up an implementation in R is to implement the algorithms in C or FORTRAN and provide an R wrapper. FlashR takes a different approach: it executes R code in parallel and scales the code beyond memory capacity by utilizing solid-state drives (SSDs) automatically. It provides a small number of generalized operations (GenOps) upon which we reimplement a large number of matrix functions in the R base package. As such, FlashR parallelizes and scales existing R code with little/no modification. To reduce data movement between CPU and SSDs, FlashR evaluates matrix operations lazily, fuses operations at runtime, and uses cache-aware, two-level matrix partitioning. We evaluate FlashR on a variety of machine learning and statistics algorithms on inputs of up to four billion data points. FlashR out-of-core tracks closely the performance of FlashR in-memory. The R code for machine learning algorithms executed in FlashR outperforms the in-memory execution of H2O and Spark MLlib by a factor of 2-10 and outperforms Revolution R Open by more than an order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Multiphoton imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators is routinely used to report activity from populations of spatially resolved neurons in vivo. However, since the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials (APs) is nonlinear and varies over neurons, quantitatively inferring AP discharge is problematic. To address this we developed a biophysical model of calcium binding kinetics for the indicator GCaMP6s that accurately describes AP-evoked fluorescence changes in vivo. The model's physical interpretation allowed the same parameters to describe GCaMP6s binding kinetics for both in vitro binding assays and in vivo imaging. Using this model, we developed an algorithm to infer APs from fluorescence and measured its accuracy with cell-attached electrical recordings. This approach consistently inferred more accurate AP counts and times than alternative methods for firing rates from 0 to >20 Hz, while requiring less training data. These results demonstrate the utility of quantitative, biophysically grounded models for complex biological data.},
