	abstract = {This work presents a novel strategy for classifying neurons, represented by nodes of a directed graph, based on their circuitry (edge connectivity). We assume a stochastic block model (SBM) where neurons belong together if they connect to neurons of other groups according to the same probability distributions. Following adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) of the SBM graph, we derive the number of classes and assign each neuron to a class with a Gaussian mixture model-based expectation-maximization (EM) clustering algorithm. To improve accuracy, we introduce a simple variation using random hierarchical agglomerative clustering to initialize the EM algorithm and picking the best solution over multiple EM restarts. We test this procedure on a large (n ~ 212 - 215 neurons), sparse, biologically inspired connectome with eight neuron classes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is broadly stable to the choice of dimensional embedding and scales extremely well as the number of neurons in the network increases. Clustering accuracy is robust to variations in model parameters and highly tolerant to simulated experimental noise, achieving perfect classifications with up to 40\% of swapped edges. Thus, this approach may be useful to analyze and interpret large-scale brain connectomics data in terms of underlying cellular components.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

 abstract = {Multiphoton imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators is routinely used to report activity from populations of spatially resolved neurons in vivo. However, since the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials (APs) is nonlinear and varies over neurons, quantitatively inferring AP discharge is problematic. To address this we developed a biophysical model of calcium binding kinetics for the indicator GCaMP6s that accurately describes AP-evoked fluorescence changes in vivo. The model's physical interpretation allowed the same parameters to describe GCaMP6s binding kinetics for both in vitro binding assays and in vivo imaging. Using this model, we developed an algorithm to infer APs from fluorescence and measured its accuracy with cell-attached electrical recordings. This approach consistently inferred more accurate AP counts and times than alternative methods for firing rates from 0 to >20 Hz, while requiring less training data. These results demonstrate the utility of quantitative, biophysically grounded models for complex biological data.},

@article{ShenDecision2018,
 abstract = {Decision forests are popular tools for classification and regression. These forests naturally produce proximity matrices measuring how often each pair of observations lies in the same leaf node. Recently it has been demonstrated that these proximity matrices can be thought of as kernels, connecting the decision forest literature to the extensive kernel machine literature. While other kernels are known to have strong theoretical properties, such as being characteristic kernels, no similar result is available for any decision forest based kernel. We show that a decision forest induced proximity can be made into a characteristic kernel, which can be used within an independence test to obtain a universally consistent test. We therefore empirically evaluate this kernel on a suite of 12 high-dimensional independence test settings: the decision forest induced kernel is shown to typically achieve substantially higher power than other methods.},
