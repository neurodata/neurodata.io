long_description: These serial thin section data were generated by Dan Bumbarger in Ralf Sommer's lab in order to compare the pharyngeal connectomes of the pharyngeal nervous system between Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus. (Cell 2013, 152:109â€“119). In P. pacificus they found clearly homologous neurons for all of the 20 pharyngeal neurons in C. elegans, but were surprised to uncover a massive rewiring of synaptic connectivity between the two species. These changes seem to correlate with known behavioral difference, most interestingly with the novel predatory feeding behaviors found in Diplogastrid nematodes such as P. pacificus.
