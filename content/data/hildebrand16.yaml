long_description: Hildebrand and colleagues acquired a multi-resolution serial-section electron microscopy data set containing the anterior quarter of a 5.5 days post fertilization larval zebrafish, including its complete brain. A draft projectome consisting of central and peripheral myelinated neurons was then reconstructed.  Electron micrographs and reconstructions are available for view in CATMAID.  A manuscript describing the data and methods used to generate it has been published in Nature.
