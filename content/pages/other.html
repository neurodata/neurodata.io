            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>Understand and improve animal and machine intelligences worldwide.</p>
        </div>
            
        <div id="philosophy">
            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Our central motivation is to understand animal and machine
            intelligences, and in particular how learning and memory arises in
            such systems.  We believe that all  intelligences operate under
            certain shared principles, much like all matter and energy are
            governed by certain principles.  By determining these foundational
            principles, we can increase the rate at which we understand and
            improve intelligences.</p> 

            <p>To do so, we design, build, study, and apply statistical machine
            learning and big data science techniques.  The tools we develop and
            utilize follow some basic design principles, including philosophical
            (validity, uncertainty), statistical (consistency, efficiency,
            robustness), and computational (scalability, tunability); see <a
            href="https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/24/modeling-desiderata.html"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog post</a> for details. While
            we don't fully understand how intelligence works, we do have some current
            working hypotheses, subject to revision given new data or theories.
            </p>

            <p>For animal intelligence, our current conjecture is that to a
            first approximation, intelligence arises largely due to
            communication between disparate entities with specialized properties
            across multiple scales. In other words, we believe that the key to
            understanding various animal intelligences is determining which
            connections between which entities with which properties at which
            scales are the mechanisms underlying the intelligences.  To answer
            these questions, we collaborate extensively with some of the best
            experimental neuroscientists in the world at different scales, each
            of whom design experiments and collect data amenable to answering
            these questions.  We then design, build, study, and apply
            statistical models and estimators designed to reveal the latent
            structures in these big connectome datasets. Because the raw data
            are never in a form amenable to directly study, we also build big
            data systems to manage, visualize, and wrangle the data. </p>

            <p>For machine intelligence we focus on studying the foundations of
            learning and memory.  We are currently pursuing a number of research
            threads, including learning in non-Euclidean contexts (e.g.,
            populations of networks with vertex and edge attributes), geodesic
            learning (which is the first step to learning from wide data), and
            lifelong learning (which means improving performance on many
            disparate tasks (past, present, and future) to improve other
            tasks).</p>

            <h3>What is NeuroData?</h3>

            <p>NeuroData is a collective of individuals dedicated to our <a href="{{g.url('/content/pages/about.html').path}}">mission</a>, and a repository of the <a href="{{g.url('/content/projects/ocp.yaml').path}}">data</a> and <a href="{{g.url('/content/pages/code.html').path}}">tools</a> we provide as free and open resources to the community.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the Open Connectome Project?</h3>
            
            <p>In 2011, we launched <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2484838.2484870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Connectome Project</a>, which is an open source software stack of Web-services that store, analyze and visualize large imaging datasets. However, as technology changed, features were added, and scale increased, our academic development team and resources became overwhelmed. We overhauled our custom stack into a <em>community-built and maintained</em> software ecosystem deployed in the commercial cloud <a href="https://neurodata.io">neurodata.io</a>, integrating multiple open-source projects and extending them for our needs. The ecosystem enables analyses on disparate datasets by re-using components originally designed for other applications.</p>
