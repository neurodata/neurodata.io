	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has unlocked unprecedented success in various domains, especially in image, text, and speech processing. These breakthroughs may hold promise for neuroscience and especially for brain-imaging investigators who start to analyze thousands of participants. However, deep learning is only beneficial if the data have nonlinear relationships and if they are exploitable at currently available sample sizes. We systematically profiled the performance of deep models, kernel models, and linear models as a function of sample size on UK Biobank brain images against established machine learning references. On MNIST and Zalando Fashion, prediction accuracy consistently improved when escalating from linear models to shallow-nonlinear models, and further improved when switching to deep-nonlinear models. The more observations were available for model training, the greater the performance gain we saw. In contrast, using structural or functional brain scans, simple linear models performed on par with more complex, highly parameterized models in age/sex prediction across increasing sample sizes. In fact, linear models kept improving as the sample size approached \~{}10,000 participants. Our results indicate that the increase in performance of linear models with additional data does not saturate at the limit of current feasibility. Yet, nonlinearities of common brain scans remain largely inaccessible to both kernel and deep learning methods at any examined scale.},

	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Decision forests are popular tools for classification and regression. These forests naturally produce proximity matrices measuring how often each pair of observations lies in the same leaf node. Recently it has been demonstrated that these proximity matrices can be thought of as kernels, connecting the decision forest literature to the extensive kernel machine literature. While other kernels are known to have strong theoretical properties, such as being characteristic kernels, no similar result is available for any decision forest based kernel. We show that a decision forest induced proximity can be made into a characteristic kernel, which can be used within an independence test to obtain a universally consistent test. We therefore empirically evaluate this kernel on a suite of 12 high-dimensional independence test settings: the decision forest induced kernel is shown to typically achieve substantially higher power than other methods.},

	abstract = {Multiphoton imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators is routinely used to report activity from populations of spatially resolved neurons in vivo. However, since the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials (APs) is nonlinear and varies over neurons, quantitatively inferring AP discharge is problematic. To address this we developed a biophysical model of calcium binding kinetics for the indicator GCaMP6s that accurately describes AP-evoked fluorescence changes in vivo. The model's physical interpretation allowed the same parameters to describe GCaMP6s binding kinetics for both in vitro binding assays and in vivo imaging. Using this model, we developed an algorithm to infer APs from fluorescence and measured its accuracy with cell-attached electrical recordings. This approach consistently inferred more accurate AP counts and times than alternative methods for firing rates from 0 to >20 Hz, while requiring less training data. These results demonstrate the utility of quantitative, biophysically grounded models for complex biological data.},

Fluorescence array tomography achieves much higher resolution and molecular multiplexing than most other fluorescence microscopy methods, while electron array tomography can capture three-dimensional ultrastructure much more easily and rapidly than traditional serial-section electron microscopy methods. A correlative fluorescence/electron microscopy mode of array tomography furthermore offers a unique capacity to merge the molecular discrimination strengths of multichannel fluorescence microscopy with the ultrastructural imaging strengths of electron microscopy.

Ideally, these organizational maps uncover the underlying structure of the brain's functional architecture, and group-level maps are accurate representations of the individuals in the sample. Using simulated fMRI data, we demonstrate that bagging improves the ability of clustering to uncover the data's underlying structure. We show that the group-level maps become more correlated to the individual-level maps with more bootstrap aggregates, suggesting bagging improves the representativeness of the group-level solution. Using a test-retest dataset of 30 young adults, we confirm these findings. More specifically, we see bagging improves the test-retest correlation between cluster maps, and increases correlation between group-level and individual-level cluster maps, and these effects are robust to number of clusters and length of scan used. These results suggest bagging is an important method for increasing reliability and validity of functional parcellation approaches.},

@article{shen2016discovering,
abstract = {Determining whether certain properties are related to other properties is fundamental to scientific discovery. As data collection rates accelerate, it is becoming increasingly difficult yet ever more important to determine whether one property of data (e.g., cloud density) is related to another (e.g., grass wetness). Only if two properties are related are further investigations into the geometry of the relationship warranted. While existing approaches can test whether two properties are related, they may require unfeasibly large sample sizes in real data scenarios, and do not provide insight into the geometry underlying the structure of the relationship. We juxtapose hypothesis testing, manifold learning, and harmonic analysis to obtain Multiscale Generalized Correlation (MGC). Our key insight is that one can adaptively restrict the analysis to the "jointly local" observations - that is, one can estimate the scale with the most informative neighbors for determining the existence and geometry of a relationship. We prove that to achieve a given true positive rate, MGC typically requires far fewer samples than existing methods for all investigated dependence structures and dimensionalities, while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, MGC uniquely provides a simple and elegant characterization of the potentially complex latent geometry underlying the relationship. We used MGC to detect the presence and reveal the geometry of the relationships between mental and brain properties, to perform a proteomics screening, and to develop an imaging biomarker for disease, while avoiding the false positive inflation problems that have plagued conventional parametric approaches. Our open source implementation of MGC is easy to use, parameter-free, and applicable to previously vexing statistical questions that are ubiquitous in science, government, finance, and other disciplines.},

abstract = {Animals move by adaptively coordinating the sequential activation of muscles. The circuit mechanisms underlying coordinated locomotion are poorly understood. Here, we report on a novel circuit for propagation of waves of muscle contraction, using the peristaltic locomotion of Drosophila larvae as a model system. We found an intersegmental chain of synaptically connected neurons, alternating excitatory and inhibitory, necessary for wave propagation and active in phase with the wave. The excitatory neurons (A27h) are premotor and necessary only for forward locomotion, and are modulated by stretch receptors and descending inputs. The inhibitory neurons (GDL) are necessary for both forward and backward locomotion, suggestive of different yet coupled central pattern generators, and its inhibition is necessary for wave propagation. The circuit structure and functional imaging indicated that the commands to contract one segment promote the relaxation of the next segment, revealing a mechanism for wave propagation in peristaltic locomotion.},

Here, we have mapped with electron microscopy the complete wiring diagram of the Drosophila larval antennal lobe, an olfactory neuropil similar to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We found a canonical circuit with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) relaying gain-controlled ORN activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the first synapse. LN-LN synaptic connections putatively implement a bistable gain control mechanism that either computes odor saliency through panglomerular inhibition, or allows some glomeruli to respond to faint aversive odors in the presence of strong appetitive odors. This complete wiring diagram will support experimental and theoretical studies towards bridging the gap between circuits and behavior.},

abstract = {The relationship between neural circuit function and patterns of synaptic connectivity is poorly understood, in part due to a lack of comparative data for larger complete systems. We compare system-wide maps of synaptic connectivity generated from serial transmission electron microscopy for the pharyngeal nervous systems of two nematodes with divergent feeding behavior: the microbivore Caenorhabditis elegans and the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus. We uncover a massive rewiring in a complex system of identified neurons, all of which are homologous based on neurite anatomy and cell body position. Comparative graph theoretical analysis reveals a striking pattern of neuronal wiring with increased connectional complexity in the anterior pharynx correlating with tooth-like denticles, a morphological feature in the mouth of P. pacificus. We apply focused centrality methods to identify neurons I1 and I2 as candidates for regulating predatory feeding and predict substantial divergence in the function of pharyngeal glands. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Even a simple sensory stimulus can elicit distinct innate behaviors and sequences. During sensorimotor decisions, competitive interactions among neurons that promote distinct behaviors must ensure the selection and maintenance of one behavior, while suppressing others. The circuit implementation of these competitive interactions is still an open question. By combining comprehensive electron microscopy reconstruction of inhibitory interneuron networks, modeling, electrophysiology, and behavioral studies, we determined the circuit mechanisms that contribute to the Drosophila larval sensorimotor decision to startle, explore, or perform a sequence of the two in response to a mechanosensory stimulus. Together, these studies reveal that, early in sensory processing, (1) reciprocally connected feedforward inhibitory interneurons implement behavioral choice, (2) local feedback disinhibition provides positive feedback that consolidates and maintains the chosen behavior, and (3) lateral disinhibition promotes sequence transitions. The combination of these interconnected circuit motifs can implement both behavior selection and the serial organization of behaviors into a sequence.},

Most modern datasets, such as those used in genetic analysis or imaging, include numerous features, such as genes or pixels. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is now generally used to find low-dimensional representations of such features for further analysis. However, PCA ignores class label information, thereby discarding data that could substantially improve downstream classification performance. We here describe an approach called "Linear Optimal Low-rank"' projection (LOL), which extends PCA by incorporating the class labels. Using theory and synthetic data, we show that LOL leads to a better representation of the data for subsequent classification than PCA while adding negligible computational cost. Experimentally we demonstrate that LOL substantially outperforms PCA in differentiating cancer patients from healthy controls using genetic data and in differentiating gender from magnetic resonance imaging data incorporating >500 million features and 400 gigabytes of data. LOL allows the solution of previous intractable problems yet requires only a few minutes to run on a single desktop computer.},

To address bottlenecks in the workflow of this emerging methodology, we developed a procedure for conductive sample embedding and a pipeline for neuron reconstruction. We reconstructed ∼98% of all neurons (>1,000) in the olfactory bulb of a zebrafish larva with high accuracy and annotated all synapses on subsets of neurons representing different types. The organization of the larval olfactory bulb showed marked differences from that of the adult but similarities to that of the insect antennal lobe. Interneurons comprised multiple types but granule cells were rare. Interglomerular projections of interneurons were complex and bidirectional. Projections were not random but biased toward glomerular groups receiving input from common types of sensory neurons. Hence, the interneuron network in the olfactory bulb exhibits a specific topological organization that is governed by glomerular identity.},

Perhaps the biggest impediment to understanding these networks is that we have no wiring diagrams of their interconnections. Even if we had a partial or complete wiring diagram, however, understanding the network would also require information about each neuron's function. Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property--the preferred stimulus orientation--of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could not be rejected.},

abstract = {CA1 pyramidal neurons are a major output of the hippocampus and encode features of experience that constitute episodic memories. Feature-selective firing of these neurons results from the dendritic integration of inputs from multiple brain regions. While it is known that synchronous activation of spatially clustered inputs can contribute to firing through the generation of dendritic spikes, there is no established mechanism for spatiotemporal synaptic clustering. Here we show that single presynaptic axons form multiple, spatially clustered inputs onto the distal, but not proximal, dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These compound connections exhibit ultrastructural features indicative of strong synapses and occur much more commonly in entorhinal than in thalamic afferents. Computational simulations revealed that compound connections depolarize dendrites in a biophysically efficient manner, owing to their inherent spatiotemporal clustering. Our results suggest that distinct afferent projections use different connectivity motifs that differentially contribute to dendritic integration.},

We demonstrate that hugin neurons use synaptic transmission in addition to peptidergic neuromodulation and identify acetylcholine as a key transmitter. Hugin neuropeptide and acetylcholine are both necessary for the regulatory effect on feeding. We further show that subtypes of hugin neurons connect chemosensory to endocrine system by combinations of synaptic and peptide-receptor connections. Targets include endocrine neurons producing DH44, a CRH-like peptide, and insulin-like peptides. Homologs of these peptides are likewise downstream of neuromedinU, revealing striking parallels in flies and mammals. We propose that hugin neurons are part of an ancient physiological control system that has been conserved at functional and molecular level.</p>},

We used large-scale serial section electron microscopy to reconstruct all the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons that target a left-right pair of glomeruli, as well as all the projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to these ORNs. We found three variations in ORN→PN connectivity. First, we found a systematic co-variation in synapse number and PN dendrite size, suggesting total synaptic conductance is tuned to postsynaptic excitability. Second, we discovered that PNs receive more synapses from ipsilateral than contralateral ORNs, providing a structural basis for odor lateralization behavior. Finally, we found evidence of imprecision in ORN→PN connections that can diminish network performance.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} by SIAM. Random Forest (RF) remains one of the most widely used general purpose classification methods. Two recent largescale empirical studies demonstrated it to be the best overall classification method among a variety of methods evaluated. One of its main limitations, however, is that it is restricted to only axis-aligned recursive partitions of the feature space. Consequently, RF is particularly sensitive to the orientation of the data. Several studies have proposed "oblique" decision forest methods to address this limitation. However, these methods either have a time and space complexity significantly greater than RF, are sensitive to unit and scale, or empirically do not perform as well as RF on real data. One promising oblique method that was proposed alongside the canonical RF method, called Forest-RC (F-RC), has not received as much attention by the community. Despite it being just as old as RF, virtually no studies exist investigating its theoretical or empirical performance. In this work, we demonstrate that F-RC empirically outperforms RF and another recently proposed oblique method called Random Rotation Random Forest, while approximately maintaining the same computational complexity. Furthermore, a variant of F-RC which rank transforms the data prior to learning is especially invariant to affine transformations and robust to data corruption. Open source code is available.},

Current approaches to store and analyze these emerging datasets are insufficient in their ability to scale in both cost-effectiveness and performance. Additionally, enabling large-scale processing and annotation is critical as these data grow too large for manual inspection. We propose a new cloud-native managed service for large and multi-modal experiments, providing support for data ingest, storage, visualization, and sharing through a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) and web-based user interface.

abstract = {Animal behaviour arises from computations in neuronal circuits, but our understanding of these computations has been frustrated by the lack of detailed synaptic connection maps, or connectomes. For example, despite intensive investigations over half a century, the neuronal implementation of local motion detection in the insect visual system remains elusive. Here we develop a semi-automated pipeline using electron microscopy to reconstruct a connectome, containing 379 neurons and 8,637 chemical synaptic contacts, within the Drosophila optic medulla. By matching reconstructed neurons to examples from light microscopy, we assigned neurons to cell types and assembled a connectome of the repeating module of the medulla. Within this module, we identified cell types constituting a motion detection circuit, and showed that the connections onto individual motion-sensitive neurons in this circuit were consistent with their direction selectivity. Our results identify cellular targets for future functional investigations, and demonstrate that connectomes can provide key insights into neuronal computations.},

@article{ohyama2015multilevel,
abstract = {Natural events present multiple types of sensory cues, each detected by a specialized sensory modality. Combining information from several modalities is essential for the selection of appropriate actions. Key to understanding multimodal computations is determining the structural patterns of multimodal convergence and how these patterns contribute to behaviour. Modalities could converge early, late or at multiple levels in the sensory processing hierarchy. Here we show that combining mechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically enhances the selection of the fastest mode of escape locomotion in Drosophila larvae. In an electron microscopy volume that spans the entire insect nervous system, we reconstructed the multisensory circuit supporting the synergy, spanning multiple levels of the sensory processing hierarchy. The wiring diagram revealed a complex multilevel multimodal convergence architecture. Using behavioural and physiological studies, we identified functionally connected circuit nodes that trigger the fastest locomotor mode, and others that facilitate it, and we provide evidence that multiple levels of multimodal integration contribute to escape mode selection. We propose that the multilevel multimodal convergence architecture may be a general feature of multisensory circuits enabling complex input-output functions and selective tuning to ecologically relevant combinations of cues.},

In the last couple of decades, several experimental paradigms have arisen that are poised to finally begin studying neuroanatomy in a high-throughput fashion. In 2005, the term connectome was coined independently by Patric Hagmann and Olaf Sporns, to describe the complete set of neural connections in a brain. Interestingly, both usages seemed to be referring to using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to study human brain networks. Shortly thereafter, Narayanan "Bobby" Kasthuri and Jeff Lichtman published an article suggesting that "connectome" should refer to connections between neurons, which one can infer using Electron Microscopy (EM) and fluorescence microscopy (e.g., brainbow animals). "Projectome", they suggested, is more appropriate for MRI based studies. Yet, the word connectome stuck, and now refers to essentially any neuroscientific investigation of the relationship between (collections of) neurons, be they functional or structural.},

abstract = {The morphology of the telencephalon displays great diversity among different vertebrate lineages. Particularly, the everted telencephalon of ray-finned fishes shows a noticeably different morphology to the evaginated telencephalon of non-ray-finned fishes and other vertebrates. This makes the comparison between the different parts of the telencephalon of ray-finned fishes and other vertebrates difficult. Based on neuroanatomical, neurochemical and connectional data no consensus on the subdivisions of the adult telencephalon of ray-finned fishes and their relation to nuclei in the telencephalon of other vertebrates has been reached yet. For tetrapods, comparative expression pattern analysis of homologous developmental genes has been a successful approach to clarify homologies between different parts of the telencephalon. In the larval zebrafish, subdivisions of the subpallium have been proposed using conserved developmental genes expression. In this study, we investigate the subdivisions of the adult zebrafish telencephalon by analyzing the expression pattern of conserved molecular marker genes. We identify the boundary between the pallium and subpallium based on the complementary expression of dlx2a, dlx5a in the subpallium and tbr1, neurod in the pallium. Furthermore, combinatorial expression of Isl, nkx2.1b, lhx1b, tbr1, eomesa, emx1, emx2 and emx3 identifies striatal-like, pallidal-like and septal-like subdivisions within the subpallium. In contrast to previous models, we propose that the striatum and pallidum are stretched along the rostro-caudal axis of the telencephalon. Further, the septal nuclei derive from both the pallium and subpallium. On this basis, we present a new model for the subdivisions of the subpallium in teleost fish.},

@article{francca2017energy,
abstract = {Energy statistics was proposed by Sz\'{e}kely in the 80's inspired by the Newtonian gravitational potential from classical mechanics, and it provides a hypothesis test for equality of distributions. It was further generalized from Euclidean spaces to metric spaces of strong negative type, and more recently, a connection with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) was established. Here we consider the clustering problem from an energy statistics theory perspective, providing a precise mathematical formulation yielding a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) in the associated RKHS, thus establishing the connection with kernel methods. We show that this QCQP is equivalent to kernel $k$-means optimization problem once the kernel is fixed. These results imply a first principles derivation of kernel $k$-means from energy statistics. However, energy statistics fixes a family of standard kernels. Furthermore, we also consider a weighted version of energy statistics, making connection to graph partitioning problems. To find local optimizers of such QCQP we propose an iterative algorithm based on Hartigan's method, which in this case has the same computational cost as kernel $k$-means algorithm, based on Lloyd's heuristic, but usually with better clustering quality. We provide carefully designed numerical experiments showing the superiority of the proposed method compared to kernel $k$-means, spectral clustering, standard $k$-means, and Gaussian mixture models in a variety of settings.},

abstract = {Deeper exploration of the brain's vast synaptic networks will require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose those networks. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. FM com-bines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigor-ous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-syn-apse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individ-ual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synap-ses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a syn-apse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical syn-apse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be use-ful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-vali-dation is not practical.},

We examined synaptic connectivity between molecularly defined inhibitory interneurons and CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites using correlative light-electron microscopy and large-volume array tomography. We show that interneurons can be highly selective in their connectivity to specific dendritic branch types and, furthermore, exhibit precisely targeted connectivity to the origin or end of individual branches. Computational simulations indicate that the observed subcellular targeting enables control over the nonlinear integration of synaptic input or the initiation and backpropagation of action potentials in a branch-selective manner.

@article{tomita2015randomer,
abstract = {Random forests (RF) is a popular general purpose classifier that has been shown to outperform many other classifiers on a variety of datasets. The widespread use of random forests can be attributed to several factors, some of which include its excellent empirical performance, scale and unit invariance, robustness to outliers, time and space complexity, and interpretability. While RF has many desirable qualities, one drawback is its sensitivity to rotations and other operations that "mix" variables. In this work, we establish a generalized forest building scheme, linear threshold forests. Random forests and many other currently existing decision forest algorithms can be viewed as special cases of this scheme. With this scheme in mind, we propose a few special cases which we call randomer forests (RerFs). RerFs are linear threshold forest that exhibit all of the nice properties of RF, in addition to approximate affine invariance. In simulated datasets designed for RF to do well, we demonstrate that RerF outperforms RF. We also demonstrate that one particular variant of RerF is approximately affine invariant. Lastly, in an evaluation on 121 benchmark datasets, we observe that RerF outperforms RF. We therefore putatively propose that RerF be considered a replacement for RF as the general purpose classifier of choice. Open source code is available at http://ttomita.github.io/RandomerForest/.},

abstract = {The CLARITY method renders brains optically transparent to enable high-resolution imaging in the structurally intact brain. Anatomically annotating CLARITY brains is necessary for discovering which regions contain signals of interest. Manually annotating whole-brain, terabyte CLARITY images is difficult, time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Automatically registering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution, but is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and subsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus compounding inter-subject anatomical variability. Additionally, the signal in CLARITY images arises from various biochemical contrast agents which only sparsely label brain structures. This sparse labeling challenges the most commonly used registration algorithms that need to match image histogram statistics to the more densely labeled histological brain atlases. The standard method is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically generates an average template as an intermediate registration target. We determined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to the Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram statistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM) for registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and learns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using Mask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the standard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM pipelines developed here provide a fast automated way to anatomically annotate CLARITY images. Our code is available as open source software at http://NeuroData.io.},

abstract = {In order to localize the neural circuits involved in generating behaviors, it is necessary to assign activity onto anatomical maps of the nervous system. Using brain registration across hundreds of larval zebrafish, we have built an expandable open-source atlas containing molecular labels and definitions of anatomical regions, the Z-Brain. Using this platform and immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a readout of neural activity, we have developed a system to create and contextualize whole-brain maps of stimulus- and behavior-dependent neural activity. This mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP)-mapping assay is technically simple, and data analysis is completely automated. Because MAP-mapping is performed on freely swimming fish, it is applicable to studies of nearly any stimulus or behavior. Here we demonstrate our high-throughput approach using pharmacological, visual and noxious stimuli, as well as hunting and feeding. The resultant maps outline hundreds of areas associated with behaviors.},

abstract = {Resurgent interest in synaptic circuitry and plasticity has emphasized the importance of 3D reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM). Three volumes of hippocampal CA1 neuropil from adult rat were imaged at X-Y resolution of $\sim$2 nm on serial sections of $\sim$50-60 nm thickness. These are the first densely reconstructed hippocampal volumes. All axons, dendrites, glia, and synapses were reconstructed in a cube ($\sim$10 $\mu$m(3)) surrounding a large dendritic spine, a cylinder ($\sim$43 $\mu$m(3)) surrounding an oblique dendritic segment (3.4 $\mu$m long), and a parallelepiped ($\sim$178 $\mu$m(3)) surrounding an apical dendritic segment (4.9 $\mu$m long). The data provide standards for identifying ultrastructural objects in 3DEM, realistic reconstructions for modeling biophysical properties of synaptic transmission, and a test bed for enhancing reconstruction tools. Representative synapses are quantified from varying section planes, and microtubules, polyribosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomes are identified and reconstructed in a subset of dendrites. The original images, traces, and Reconstruct software and files are freely available and visualized at the Open Connectome Project (Data Citation 1).},

This facilitates interro-gation with light sheet microscopy and penetration of molecular probes while avoiding physical slicing. In this work, we develop a pipeline for registering CLARIfied mouse brains to an annotated brain atlas. Due to the novelty of this microscopy technique it is impractical to use absolute intensity values to align these images to existing standard atlases. Thus we adopt a large deformation diffeomorphic approach for registering images via mutual information matching. Furthermore we show how a cascaded multi-resolution approach can improve registration quality while reducing algorithm run time. As acquired image volumes were over a terabyte in size, they were far too large for work on personal computers. Therefore the NeuroData computational infrastructure was deployed for multi-resolution storage and visualization of these images and aligned annotations on the web.},

Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes.

@article{Kiar2018,
abstract = {Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, and adding to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols), resulting in failures to replicate. Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroData's MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies ($\sim$6,000 scans) from 15 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site, and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies - much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We, therefore, provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.},

abstract = {Graphs are quickly emerging as a leading abstraction for the representation of data. One important application domain originates from an emerging discipline called “connectomics”. Connectomics studies the brain as a graph; vertices correspond to neurons (or collections thereof) and edges correspond to structural or functional connections between them. To explore the variability of connectomes-to address both basic science questions regarding the structure of the brain, and medical health questions about psychiatry and neurology-one can study the topological properties of these brain-graphs. We define multivariate glocal graph invariants: these are features of the graph that capture various local and global topological properties of the graphs. We show that the collection of features can collectively be computed via a combination of daisy-chaining, sparse matrix representation and computations, and efficient approximations. Our custom open-source Python package serves as a back-end to a Web-service that we have created to enable researchers to upload graphs, and download the corresponding invariants in a number of different formats. Moreover, we built this package to support distributed processing on multicore machines. This is therefore an enabling technology for network science, lowering the barrier of entry by providing tools to biologists and analysts who otherwise lack these capabilities. As a demonstration, we run our code on 120 brain-graphs, each with approximately 16M vertices and up to 90M edges.},

In this paper, we propose a model-free approach to test independence between network topology and nodal attributes, via diffusion maps and distance-based correlations. We prove in theory that the diffusion maps based on the adjacency matrix from an infinitely exchangeable graph can provide a set of conditionally independent coordinates for each node in graph, which yields a consistent test statistic for network dependence testing with distance-based correlations combined. The new approach excels in capturing nonlinear and high-dimensional network dependencies, and is robust against parameter choices and noise, as demonstrated by superior testing powers throughout various popular network models.

FlashEigen performs sparse matrix multiplication in a semi-external memory fashion, i.e., we keep the sparse matrix on SSDs and the dense matrix in memory. We store the entire vector subspace on SSDs and reduce I/O to improve performance through caching the most recent dense matrix.

Furthermore, on a single large parallel machine, our SEM-SpMM operates as fast as the distributed implementations of Trilinos using five times as much processing power. We also run our implementation in memory (IM-SpMM) to quantify the overhead of keeping data on SSDs. SEM-SpMM achieves almost 100% performance of IM-SpMM on graphs when the dense matrix has more than four columns; it achieves at least 65% performance of IM-SpMM on all inputs. We apply our SpMM to three important data analysis tasks--PageRank, eigensolving, and non-negative matrix factorization--and show that our SEM implementations significantly advance the state of the art.},

abstract = {Replicated network data are increasingly available in many research fields. In connectomic applications, inter-connections among brain regions are collected for each patient under study, motivating statistical models which can flexibly characterize the probabilistic generative mechanism underlying these network-valued data. Available models for a single network are not designed specifically for inference on the entire probability mass function of a network-valued random variable and therefore lack flexibility in characterizing the distribution of relevant topological structures. We propose a flexible Bayesian nonparametric approach for modeling the population distribution of network-valued data. The joint distribution of the edges is defined via a mixture model which reduces dimensionality and efficiently incorporates network information within each mixture component by leveraging latent space representations. The formulation leads to an efficient Gibbs sampler and provides simple and coherent strategies for inference and goodness-of-fit assessments. We provide theoretical results on the flexibility of our model and illustrate improved performance --- compared to state-of-the-art models --- in simulations and application to human brain networks.},

Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients with cancers of the ovary, liver, esophagus, pancreas, stomach, colorectum, lung or breast who were thought to have Stage I to III disease prior to surgery were eligible for inclusion in the study. Peripheral blood was collected after informed consent was obtained and prior to the patients undergoing surgical resection. Patients who were later recognized to have received neo-adjuvant therapy, patients who were found to have stage IV cancer at the time of surgical resection, and patients in whom blood was documented to be collected while anesthesia was administered (20), were excluded from the study. General demographics, surgical pathology, and AJCC stage (7th edition) were documented. The 'healthy' cohort consisted of peripheral blood samples obtained from 812 individuals of median age 55 (IQR interquartile range 28 to 65) with no history of cancer. The cancer and healthy control samples were processed in an identical manner. Plasma samples from 46 of the 1,005 cancer patients and 181 of the 812 normal samples had been previously evaluated with a different approach (20) (table S4).

Specifically, a joint nearest-neighbor graph is built for all modalities. Then the shortest-path distance within each modality is calculated from the joint neighborhood graph, followed by embedding into and matching in a common low-dimensional Euclidean space.

Fitting statistical models to such data, to enable parameter estimation and time-series prediction, is an important computational primitive. Existing methods, however, are unable to cope with the high-dimensional nature of these data, due to both computational and statistical reasons. We mitigate both kinds of issues by proposing an M-estimator for Reduced-rank System IDentification (Mr. Sid). A combination of low-rank approximations, ℓ1 and ℓ2 penalties, and some numerical linear algebra tricks, yields an estimator that is computationally efficient and numerically stable. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a variety of problems. In particular, we demonstrate that Mr. Sid can accurately estimate spatial filters, connectivity graphs, and time-courses from native resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Mr. Sid therefore enables big time-series data to be analyzed using standard methods, readying the field for further generalizations including nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models.},

abstract = {Biological and social systems consist of myriad interacting units. The interactions can be represented in the form of a graph or network. Measurements of these graphs can reveal the underlying structure of these interactions, which provides insight into the systems that generated the graphs. Moreover, in applications such as connectomics, social networks, and genomics, graph data are accompanied by contextualizing measures on each node. We utilize these node covariates to help uncover latent communities in a graph, using a modification of spectral clustering. Statistical guarantees are provided under a joint mixture model that we call the node-contextualized stochastic blockmodel, including a bound on the mis-clustering rate. The bound is used to derive conditions for achieving perfect clustering. For most simulated cases, covariate-assisted spectral clustering yields results superior to regularized spectral clustering without node covariates and to an adaptation of canonical correlation analysis. We apply our clustering method to large brain graphs derived from diffusion MRI data, using the node locations or neurological region membership as covariates. In both cases, covariate-assisted spectral clustering yields clusters that are easier to interpret neurologically.},

abstract = {Much recent attention has been paid to quantifying anatomic and functional neuroimaging on the individual subject level. For optimal individual subject characterization, specific acquisition and analysis features need to be identified that maximize interindividual variability while concomitantly minimizing intra-subject variability. We delineate the effect of various acquisition parameters (length of acquisition, sampling frequency) and analysis methods (time course extraction, region of interest parcellation, and thresholding of connectivity-derived network graphs) on characterizing individual subject differentiation. We utilize a non-parametric statistical metric that quantifies the degree to which a parameter set allows this individual subject differentiation by both maximizing interindividual variance and minimizing intra-individual variance. We apply this metric to analysis of four publicly available test-retest resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data sets. We find that for the question of maximizing individual differentiation, (i) for increasing sampling, there is a relative tradeoff between increased sampling frequency and increased acquisition time; (ii) for the sizes of the interrogated data sets, only 3-4 min of acquisition time was sufficient to maximally differentiate each subject with an algorithm that utilized no a priori information regarding subject identification; and (iii) brain regions that most contribute to this individual subject characterization lie in the default mode, attention, and executive control networks. These findings may guide optimal rs-fMRI experiment design and may elucidate the neural bases for subject-to-subject differences.

abstract = {Reconstructing a map of neuronal connectivity is a critical challenge in contemporary neuroscience. Recent advances in high-throughput serial section electron microscopy (EM) have produced massive 3D image volumes of nanoscale brain tissue for the first time. The resolution of EM allows for individual neurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Recovering neuronal networks by manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is unmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image processing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the solution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse identification). In this manuscript we present the first fully-automated images-to-graphs pipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue and produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall performance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a metric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We evaluate a set of algorithms and parameters, searching possible operating points to identify the best available brain graph for our assessment metric. Finally, we deploy a reference end-to-end version of the pipeline on a large, publicly available data set. This provides a baseline result and framework for community analysis and future algorithm development and testing. All code and data derivatives have been made publicly available in support of eventually unlocking new biofidelic computational primitives and understanding of neuropathologies.},

Its attention can be partially attributed to its computational difficulty. Although many heuristics have previously been proposed in the literature to approximately solve graph matching, very few have any theoretical support for their performance. A common technique is to relax the discrete problem to a continuous problem, therefore enabling practitioners to bring gradient-descent-type algorithms to bear. We prove that an indefinite relaxation (when solved exactly) almost always discovers the optimal permutation, while a common convex relaxation almost always fails to discover the optimal permutation. These theoretical results suggest that initializing the indefinite algorithm with the convex optimum might yield improved practical performance. Indeed, experimental results illuminate and corroborate these theoretical findings, demonstrating that excellent results are achieved in both benchmark and real data problems by amalgamating the two approaches.},

abstract = {Machine learning is a popular method for mining and analyzing large collections of medical data. We focus on a particular problem from medical research, supervised multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We examine the extent to which the choice of machine learning or classification algorithm and feature extraction function impacts the performance of lesion segmentation methods. As quantitative measures derived from structural MRI are important clinical tools for research into the pathophysiology and natural history of MS, the development of automated lesion segmentation methods is an active research field. Yet, little is known about what drives performance of these methods. We evaluate the performance of automated MS lesion segmentation methods, which consist of a supervised classification algorithm composed with a feature extraction function. These feature extraction functions act on the observed T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI voxel intensities. Each MRI study has a manual lesion segmentation that we use to train and validate the supervised classification algorithms. Our main finding is that the differences in predictive performance are due more to differences in the feature vectors, rather than the machine learning or classification algorithms. Features that incorporate information from neighboring voxels in the brain were found to increase performance substantially. For lesion segmentation, we conclude that it is better to use simple, interpretable, and fast algorithms, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis, and to develop the features to improve performance.},

This model naturally leads to a set of estimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or "signal-subgraph," defined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between the classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal and efficient, but differ by their assumption about the "coherency" of the signal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges "stick together" around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best estimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but also the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a contemporary neuroscience question: can we classify "connectomes" (brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better than all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates that even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of training samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of salt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that human brain is a complicated network and many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related to abnormal changes of the brain network architecture. In this work, we present a kernel-based method to establish a network for each subject using mean cortical thickness, which we refer to hereafter as the individual's network. We construct individual networks for 83 subjects, including AD patients and normal controls (NC), which are taken from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. The network edge features are used to make prediction of AD/NC through the sophisticated machine learning technology. As the number of edge features is much more than that of samples, feature selection is applied to avoid the adverse impact of high-dimensional data on the performance of classifier. We use a hybrid feature selection that combines filter and wrapper methods, and compare the performance of six different combinations of them. Finally, support vector machines are trained using the selected features. To obtain an unbiased evaluation of our method, we use a nested cross validation framework to choose the optimal hyper-parameters of classifier and evaluate the generalization of the method. We report the best accuracy of 90.4 % using the proposed method in the leave-one-out analysis, outperforming that using the raw cortical thickness data by more than 10 %.},

Spectral partioning using the normalized Laplacian and the adjacency matrix have both been shown to be consistent as the number of vertices tend to infinity. Importantly, both procedures require that the number of blocks and the rank of the communication probability matrix are known, even as the rest of the parameters may be unknown. In this article, we prove that the (suitably modified) adjacency-spectral partitioning procedure, requiring only an upper bound on the rank of the communication probability matrix, is consistent. Indeed, this result demonstrates a robustness to model mis-specification; an overestimate of the rank may impose a moderate performance penalty, but the procedure is still consistent. Furthermore, we extend this procedure to the setting where adjacencies may have multiple modalities and we allow for either directed or undirected graphs.},

abstract = {New DNA sequencing methods will soon make it possible to identify all germline variants in any individual at a reasonable cost. However, the ability of whole-genome sequencing to predict predisposition to common diseases in the general population is unknown. To estimate this predictive capacity, we use the concept of a "genometype." A specific genometype represents the genomes in the population conferring a specific level of genetic risk for a specified disease. Using this concept, we estimated the maximum capacity of whole-genome sequencing to identify individuals at clinically significant risk for 24 different diseases. Our estimates were derived from the analysis of large numbers of monozygotic twin pairs; twins of a pair share the same genometype and therefore identical genetic risk factors. Our analyses indicate that (i) for 23 of the 24 diseases, most of the individuals will receive negative test results; (ii) these negative test results will, in general, not be very informative, because the risk of developing 19 of the 24 diseases in those who test negative will still be, at minimum, 50 to 80% of that in the general population; and (iii) on the positive side, in the best-case scenario, more than 90% of tested individuals might be alerted to a clinically significant predisposition to at least one disease. These results have important implications for the valuation of genetic testing by industry, health insurance companies, public policy-makers, and consumers.},

To address the question of whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience hypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified version of supervenience (called $\epsilon$-supervenience) that is amenable to experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided determination of $\epsilon$-supervenience. The physical property of the brain employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the brain-graph or connectome). $\epsilon$-supervenience allows us to determine whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to within any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the relationship between the two. This may provide further motivation for cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.},

How these intrinsic and extrinsic factors govern the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations is unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, we investigated the dependencies between synaptic connectivity, feature selectivity and network activity in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in mouse visual cortex. In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways.},

Recently-introduced calcium fluorescent imaging methods permit experimentalists to observe network activity in large popu lations of neurons, but these techniques provide only indirect observations of neural spike trains, with limited time resolution and signal quality. In this work we present a Bayesian approach for inferring neural circuitry given this type of imaging data. We model the network activity in terms of a collec tion of coupled hidden Markov chains, with each chain corresponding to a single neuron in the network and the coupling between the chains reflecting the network's connectivity matrix. We derive a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for fitting the model parameters; to obtain the suf ficient statistics in a computationally-efficient manner, we introduce a spe cialized blockwise-Gibbs algorithm for sampling from the joint activity of all observed neurons given the observed fluorescence data. We perform large scale simulations of randomly connected neuronal networks with biophysi cally realistic parameters and find that the proposed methods can accurately infer the connectivity in these networks given reasonable experimental and computational constraints. In addition, the estimation accuracy may be im proved significantly by incorporating prior knowledge about the sparseness of connectivity in the network, via standard L\ penalization methods.},

While the raw data are fluorescence movies, the underlying spike trains are of interest. This work presents a fast non-negative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train for each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm is fast enough that even when imaging over 100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real-time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates.},

abstract = {As recent advances in calcium sensing technologies facilitate simultaneously imaging action potentials in neuronal populations, complementary analytical tools must also be developed to maximize the utility of this experimental paradigm. Although the observations here are fluorescence movies, the signals of interest - spike trains and/or time varying intracellular calcium concentrations - are hidden. Inferring these hidden signals is often problematic due to noise, nonlinearities, slow imaging rate, and unknown biophysical parameters. We overcome these difficulties by developing sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters) based on biophysical models of spiking, calcium dynamics, and fluorescence. We show that even in simple cases, the particle filters outperform the optimal linear (i.e., Wiener) filter, both by obtaining better estimates and by providing error bars. We then relax a number of our model assumptions to incorporate nonlinear saturation of the fluorescence signal, as well external stimulus and spike history dependence (e.g., refractoriness) of the spike trains. Using both simulations and in vitro fluorescence observations, we demonstrate temporal superresolution by inferring when within a frame each spike occurs. Furthermore, the model parameters may be estimated using expectation maximization with only a very limited amount of data (e.g., ∼5-10 s or 5-40 spikes), without the requirement of any simultaneous electrophysiology or imaging experiments. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

The model allows for analog membrane dynamics and an arbitrary number of synaptic connections, each with tunable conductance and reversal potential. The array of silicon neurons functions as an address-event (AE) transceiver, with incoming and outgoing spikes communicated over an asynchronous event-driven digital bus. Address encoding and conflict resolution of spiking events are implemented via a randomized arbitration scheme that ensures balanced servicing of event requests across the array. Routing of events is implemented externally using dynamically programmable random-access memory that stores a postsynaptic address, the conductance, and the reversal potential of each synaptic connection.

In the upright orientation, saccades generally land several degrees above the target. The origin of this asymmetry has remained unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the asymmetry in memory saccades is dependent on body orientation in space. Thus animals performed memory saccades in four different body orientations: upright, left-side-down (LSD), right-side-down (RSD), and supine. Data in all three rhesus monkeys confirm previous observations regarding a significant upward vertical asymmetry. Saccade errors made from LSD and RSD postures were partitioned into components made along the axis of gravity and along the vertical body axis. Up/down asymmetry persisted only in body coordinates but not in gravity coordinates. However, this asymmetry was generally reduced in tilted positions. Therefore the upward bias seen in memory saccades is egocentric although orientation in space might play a modulatory role.},

abstract = {Allelic deletions involving the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p13-21.1) have been observed frequently in cervical carcinomas. Recently, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad), was cloned and mapped to this chromosomal region (3p14.2). Abnormal FHIT transcripts have been identified previously in a variety of tumor cell lines and primary carcinomas, although their significance and the molecular mechanisms underlying their origin remain incompletely defined. In addition, integration of human papillomavirus DNA has been identified at a fragile site (FRA3B) within the FHIT locus in cervical cancer. These observations motivated us to evaluate FHIT mRNA and protein expression in cervical cancer cell lines, primary cervical carcinomas, and normal tissues. Transcripts of the expected size and sequence were the predominant species identified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in cultured keratinocytes and all normal tissues evaluated. In contrast, aberrant FHIT transcripts were readily demonstrated in 6 of 7 cervical carcinoma cell lines and 17 of 25 (68%) primary cervical carcinomas. Northern blot analyses demonstrated reduced or absent FHIT expression in the cervical carcinoma cell lines, particularly those with aberrant RT-PCR products. Immunohistochemical analysis of Fhit expression in cervical tissues revealed strong immunoreactivity in nonneoplastic squamous and glandular cervical epithelium and marked reduction or loss of Fhit protein in 25 of 33 (76%) primary cervical carcinomas. In those cervical cancer cell lines and primary tumors with exclusively aberrant or absent FHIT transcripts by RT-PCR, Fhit protein expression was always markedly reduced or absent. The frequent alterations in FHIT expression in many cervical carcinomas, but not in normal tissues, suggest that FHIT gene alterations may play an important role in cervical tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Although it has been over a century since neuroscientists first conjectured that networks of neurons comprise the brain, technology has limited high-throughput investigations of neural circuitry until very recently. In the last couple of decades, several experimental paradigms have arisen that are poised to finally begin studying neuroanatomy in a high-throughput fashion. In 2005, the term connectome was coined independently by Patric Hagmann and Olaf Sporns, to describe the complete set of neural connections in a brain. Interestingly, both usages seemed to be referring to using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to study human brain networks. Shortly thereafter, Narayanan "Bobby" Kasthuri and Jeff Lichtman published an article suggesting that "connectome" should refer to connections between neurons, which one can infer using Electron Microscopy (EM) and fluorescence microscopy (e.g., brainbow animals). "Projectome", they suggested, is more appropriate for MRI based studies. Yet, the word connectome stuck, and now refers to essentially any neuroscientific investigation of the relationship between (collections of) neurons, be they functional or structural.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). R is one of the most popular programming languages for statistics and machine learning, but it is slow and unable to scale to large datasets. The general approach for having an efficient algorithm in R is to implement it in C or FORTRAN and provide an R wrapper. FlashR accelerates and scales existing R code by parallelizing a large number of matrix functions in the R base package and scaling them beyond memory capacity with solid-state drives (SSDs). FlashR performs memory hierarchy aware execution to speed up parallelized R code by (i) evaluating matrix operations lazily, (ii) performing all operations in a DAG in a single execution and with only one pass over data to increase the ratio of computation to I/O, (iii) performing two levels of matrix partitioning and reordering computation on matrix partitions to reduce data movement in the memory hierarchy. We evaluate FlashR on various machine learning and statistics algorithms on inputs of up to four billion data points. Despite the huge performance gap between SSDs and RAM, FlashR on SSDs closely tracks the performance of FlashR in memory for many algorithms. The R implementations in FlashR outperforms H 2 O and Spark MLlib by a factor of 3 -20.},

In this work, we specifically focus on the case of images and adopt an optimal control point of view so as to extend the original LDDMM with Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) matching term to a framework more robust to intensity variations, which is critical for cross-modality registration. We implement a mutual information based LDDMM (MI-LDDMM) algorithm and demonstrate its superiority to SSD-LDDMM in aligning 2D phantoms with differing intensity profiles. This algorithm is then used to register CLARITY mouse brain images to a standard mouse atlas despite their differences in grayscale values. We complement the approach by showing how a cascaded multi-scale method improves the optimization while reducing the run time of the algorithm.},

abstract = {The CLARITY method renders brains optically transparent to enable high-resolution imaging in the structurally intact brain. Anatomically annotating CLARITY brains is necessary for discovering which regions contain signals of interest. Manually annotating whole-brain, terabyte CLARITY images is difficult, time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. Automatically registering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution, but is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and subsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus compounding inter-subject anatomical variability. Additionally, the signal in CLARITY images arises from various biochemical contrast agents which only sparsely label brain structures. This sparse labeling challenges the most commonly used registration algorithms that need to match image histogram statistics to the more densely labeled histological brain atlases. The standard method is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically generates an average template as an intermediate registration target. We determined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to the Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram statistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM) for registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and learns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using Mask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the standard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM pipelines developed here provide a fast automated way to anatomically annotate CLARITY images. Our code is available as open source software at http://NeuroData.io.},

abstract = {Graph analysis performs many random reads and writes, thus, these workloads are typically performed in memory. Traditionally, analyzing large graphs requires a cluster of machines so the aggregate memory exceeds the graph size. We demonstrate that a multicore server can process graphs with billions of vertices and hundreds of billions of edges, utilizing commodity SSDs with minimal performance loss. We do so by implementing a graph-processing engine on top of a user-space SSD file system designed for high IOPS and extreme parallelism. Our semi-external memory graph engine called FlashGraph stores vertex state in memory and edge lists on SSDs. It hides latency by overlapping computation with I/O. To save I/O bandwidth, FlashGraph only accesses edge lists requested by applications from SSDs; to increase I/O throughput and reduce CPU overhead for I/O, it conservatively merges I/O requests. These designs maximize performance for applications with different I/O characteristics. FlashGraph exposes a general and flexible vertex-centric programming interface that can express a wide variety of graph algorithms and their optimizations. We demonstrate that FlashGraph in semi-external memory performs many algorithms with performance up to 80% of its in-memory implementation and significantly outperforms PowerGraph, a popular distributed in-memory graph engine.},

We extend previous Bayesian nonparamet- ric models of neural spiking to jointly detect and cluster neurons using a Gamma process model. Importantly, we develop an online approximate inference scheme enabling real-time analysis, with performance exceeding the previous state-of-the- art. Via exploratory data analysis—using data with partial ground truth as well as two novel data sets—we find several features of our model collectively contribute to our improved performance including: (i) accounting for colored noise, (ii) de- tecting overlapping spikes, (iii) tracking waveform dynamics, and (iv) using mul- tiple channels.

The method can deal with weighted or unweighted graphs, as well as multimodal data, where different graphs represent different types of data. The proposed approach is also naturally integrated with collaborative graph inference techniques, solving general network inference problems where the observed variables, possibly coming from different modalities, are not in correspondence. The algorithm is tested and compared with state-of-the-art graph matching techniques in both synthetic and real graphs. We also present results on multimodal graphs and applications to collaborative inference of brain connectivity from alignment-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

Experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over existing similarity measures.

Thanks to recent developments in digital acquisition techniques, powerful image analysis algorithms are developed which can be useful non-invasive tools to assist in the restoration and preservation of art. In this paper we propose a semi-supervised crack detection method that can be used for high-dimensional acquisitions of paintings coming from different modalities. Our dataset consists of a recently acquired collection of images of the Ghent Altarpiece (1432), one of Northern Europe's most important art masterpieces. Our goal is to build a classifier that is able to discern crack pixels from the background consisting of non-crack pixels, making optimal use of the information that is provided by each modality. To accomplish this we employ a recently developed non-parametric Bayesian classifier, that uses tensor factorizations to characterize any conditional probability. A prior is placed on the parameters of the factorization such that every possible interaction between predictors is allowed while still identifying a sparse subset among these predictors. The proposed Bayesian classifier, which we will refer to as conditional Bayesian tensor factorization or CBTF, is assessed by visually comparing classification results with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Our motivation comes from the problem of aligning 3D brain MRI with 100 micron isotropic resolution, to histology sections with 1 micron in plane resolution. Multiple stains, as well as damaged, folded, or missing tissue are common in this situation. We overcome these challenges by introducing two new concepts. Cross modality image matching is achieved by jointly estimating polynomial transformations of the atlas intensity, together with pose and deformation parameters. Missing data is accommodated via a multiple atlas selection procedure where several atlases may be of homogeneous intensity and correspond to “background” or “artifact”. The two concepts are combined within an Expectation Maximization algorithm, where atlas selection posteriors and deformation parameters are updated iteratively, and polynomial coefficients are computed in closed form. We show results for 3D reconstruction of digital pathology and MRI in standard atlas coordinates. In conjunction with convolutional neural networks, we quantify the 3D density distribution of tauopathy throughout the medial temporal lobe of an Alzheimer’s disease postmortem specimen.},

For prediction of the hidden fields we introduce the generalized expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) for which the E-step calculates the conditional mean of the hidden variates simultaneously combined with the diffeomorphic correspondences between atlas and target coordinate systems. The algorithm is run to fixed points guaranteeing estimators satisfy the necessary maximizer conditions when interpreted as likelihood estimators.
