[TOC]

To run analysis on our data we offer the following options

### CloudVolume

To download portions or entire datasets as TIFF stacks or individual files for local analysis, use [CloudVolume](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume).

### Igneous

To perform computations on datasets we recommend [Igneous](https://github.com/seung-lab/igneous).  Igneous supports distributed cloud computing infrastructure to operate over large datasets.

### Analysis pipelines

Our analysis pipelines are under active development.  Please take a look at our list of maintained [tools]([url('/content/pages/tools.html')]).  We are currently working on guides for cell detections and registration pipelines. If there's anything else you would like to see, please let us know.
