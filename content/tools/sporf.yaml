details:
  - "SPORF (Sparse Projection Oblique Randomer Forests) combines sparse random projections with the random forest algorithm to achieve high accuracy on a variety of datasets."

  - "Currently available in Python and R (not actively developed), SPORF is supported on Linux and Mac OS (and Windows via WSL)."

  - "SPORF is optimized for both speed and memory performance through native implementation and multicore parallelization."

  - 'Available in a pre-built <a href="https://gigantum.com/neurodata/sporf-paper">Gigantum project.</a>'
