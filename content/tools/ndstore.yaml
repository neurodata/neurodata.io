description: NeuroData provides a scalable database cluster for the spatial analysis and annotation of high-throughput brain imaging data for 3D image stacks, time-series and multi-channel data (e.g., electron microscopy, array tomography, CLARITY, histology, and multimodal MRI data). The system is designed primarily for workloads that build connectomes—neural connectivity maps of the brain—using the parallel execution of computer vision algorithms on high-performance compute clusters. These services and open science data sets are publicly available at neurodata.io. The system design inherits much from NoSQL scale-out and data-intensive computing architectures. We distribute data to cluster nodes by partitioning a spatial index. We direct I/O to different systems—reads to parallel disk arrays and writes to solid-state storage—to avoid I/O interference and maximize throughput. All programming interfaces are RESTful Web services, which are simple and stateless, improving scalability and usability. We include a performance evaluation of the production system, highlighting the effectiveness of spatial data organization.
