details:
  - "m2g provides robust and reliable estimates of MRI connectivity across a wide range of datasets at 1mm resolution, across 25 parcellations, ranging in size from 48 to 72,000 nodes, all in MNI152 standard space."

  - "m2g is a turn-key pipeline that provides session and group-level analysis, performing connectome estimation and summary statistic computation."

  - "m2g runs reliably and robustly datasets spanning multiple scanners, acquisition parameters, and population demographics."
