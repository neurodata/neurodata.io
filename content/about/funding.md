#### [Sensorimotor processing, decision-making, and internal states: towards a realistic multiscale circuit model of the larval zebrafish brain](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/U19-NS104653-02)

**1U19NS104653-01 (Engert)**: 09/01/2017 - 08/31/2022

The general goal of the proposal is to generate a realistic multiscale circuit model of the larval
zebrafish’s brain – the multiscale virtual fish (MSVF). The model will span spatial ranges from the
nanoscale at the synaptic level, to local microcircuits to inter-area connectivity - and its ultimate
purpose is to explain and simulate the quantitative and qualitative nature of behavioral output across
various timescales.

#### Connectome Coding at the Synaptic Scale

This project will study learning and plasticity at an unprecedented scale, revealing the dynamics of
large populations of synapses comprising an entire local cortical circuit. No previously conducted
experiment could answer the questions about the dynamics of large populations of synapses, which
is crucial to the learning process.
