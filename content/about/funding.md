#### [Multiscale Generalized Correlation: A Unified Distance-Based Correlation Measure for Dependence Discovery](http://grantome.com/grant/NSF/DMS-1921310)
**1712947 (Shen)**: 05/01/2017 - 04/30/2020  
*NSF*

This project aims to establish a unified methodology framework for statistical testing in highdimensional, noisy, big data, through theoretical advancements, comprehensive simulations, and real
data experiments.  

*This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation award DMS1712947.*


#### [CRCNS US-German Res Prop: functional computational anatomy of the auditory cortex](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-DC016784-02)
**1R01DC016784-01 (Ratnanather)**: 07/01/2017 - 06/30/2020  
*NIH*

The goal of this project is to create a robust computational framework for analyzing the cortical ribbon
in a specific region: the auditory cortex.


#### [NeuroNex Innovation Award: Towards Automatic Analysis of Multi-Terabyte Cleared Brains](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1707298)
**1707298 (Vogelstein)**: 07/01/2017 - 06/30/2019  
*NSF, 16-569 Neural System Cluster*

We propose to lower the barrier to connecting data to analyses and models by providing a coherent
cloud computational ecosystem that minimizes current bottlenecks in the scientific process.

*We would like to acknowledge generous support from National Science
Foundation (NSF) under NSF Award Number EEC-1707298.*

#### What Would Tukey Do?
**FA8750-17-2-0112 (Priebe)**: 10/01/2016 - 09/30/2020  
*DARPA*

The goal is to develop theory & methods for generating a discoverable archive of data modeling
primitives and for automatically selecting model primitives and for composing selected primitives into
complex modeling pipelines based on user-specified data and outcome(s) of interest.

#### [Sensorimotor processing, decision-making, and internal states: towards a realistic multiscale circuit model of the larval zebrafish brain](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/U19-NS104653-02)
**1U19NS104653-01 (Engert)**: 09/01/2017 - 08/31/2022  
*Harvard University / Prime: NIH*

The general goal of the proposal is to generate a realistic multiscale circuit model of the larval
zebrafish’s brain – the multiscale virtual fish (MSVF). The model will span spatial ranges from the
nanoscale at the synaptic level, to local microcircuits to inter-area connectivity - and its ultimate
purpose is to explain and simulate the quantitative and qualitative nature of behavioral output across
various timescales.

#### Connectome Coding at the Synaptic Scale
**Vogelstein**: 1/01/2018 - 12/31/2019  
*Schmidt Sciences*

This project will study learning and plasticity at an unprecedented scale, revealing the dynamics of
large populations of synapses comprising an entire local cortical circuit. No previously conducted
experiment could answer the questions about the dynamics of large populations of synapses, which
is crucial to understanding the learning process.

#### Lifelong Learning Forests
**FA8650-18-2-7834 (Vogelstein)**: 11/1/2017 - 10/31/2021  
*DARPA*

Our Lifelong Learning Forests (L2Fs) will learn continuously, selectively adapting to new
environments and circumstances utilizing top-down feedback to impact low-level processing, with
provable statistical guarantees, while maintaining computational tractability at scale. 

*This work is graciously supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Lifelong Learning Machines program through contract FA8650-18-2-7834.*

#### Continual Learning Across Synapses, Circuits, and Brain Areas 
**FA8650-18-2-7834 (Tolias)**: 11/1/2017 - 10/31/2021
