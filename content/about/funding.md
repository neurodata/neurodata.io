**1712947 (Shen)**: 05/01/2017 - 04/30/2020  
_NSF_

This project aims to establish a unified methodology framework for statistical testing in highdimensional, noisy, big data, through theoretical advancements, comprehensive simulations, and real
data experiments.

_This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation award DMS1712947._

#### [Sensorimotor processing, decision-making, and internal states: towards a realistic multiscale circuit model of the larval zebrafish brain](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/U19-NS104653-02)

**1U19NS104653-01 (Engert)**: 09/01/2017 - 08/31/2022  
_Harvard University / Prime: NIH_

The general goal of the proposal is to generate a realistic multiscale circuit model of the larval
zebrafish’s brain – the multiscale virtual fish (MSVF). The model will span spatial ranges from the
nanoscale at the synaptic level, to local microcircuits to inter-area connectivity - and its ultimate
purpose is to explain and simulate the quantitative and qualitative nature of behavioral output across
various timescales.

#### Connectome Coding at the Synaptic Scale

**Vogelstein**: 1/01/2018 - 12/31/2019  
_Schmidt Sciences_

This project will study learning and plasticity at an unprecedented scale, revealing the dynamics of
large populations of synapses comprising an entire local cortical circuit. No previously conducted
experiment could answer the questions about the dynamics of large populations of synapses, which
is crucial to understanding the learning process.

#### Lifelong Learning Forests

**FA8650-18-2-7834 (Vogelstein)**: 11/1/2017 - 10/31/2021  
_DARPA_

Our Lifelong Learning Forests (L2Fs) will learn continuously, selectively adapting to new
environments and circumstances utilizing top-down feedback to impact low-level processing, with
provable statistical guarantees, while maintaining computational tractability at scale.
