about: The synapse is the principle active signaling component of the brain's circuitry. As such, tools to visualize, detect, and label synapses would be a useful resource for the neuroscience community. The Open Synaptome Project, a collaboration between NeuroData and the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/" target="_blank">Allen Institute for Brain Science</a>, provides a synaptic analysis toolbox open to the scientific community as well as open access to the array tomography data generated by the Allen Institute.
